Shahrukh Khan[a] (pronounced [ˈʃɑːɦɾʊx xɑːn] ⓘ; born 2 November 1965), also known by the initialism SRK, is an Indian actor and film producer who works in Hindi cinema. Referred to in the media as the "Baadshah of Bollywood" and "King Khan",[b] he has appeared in more than 100 films, and earned numerous accolades, including 14 Filmfare Awards. He has been awarded the Padma Shri by the Government of India, as well as the Order of Arts and Letters and Legion of Honour by the Government of France. Khan has a significant following in Asia and the Indian diaspora worldwide. In terms of audience size and income, several media outlets have described him as one of the most successful film stars in the world.[c] Many of his films thematise Indian national identity and connections with diaspora communities, or gender, racial, social and religious differences and grievances.

Khan began his career with appearances in several television series in the late 1980s and made his Bollywood debut in 1992 with the musical romance Deewana. He was initially recognised for playing villainous roles in the films Baazigar (1993) and Darr (1993). Khan established himself by starring in a series of top-grossing romantic films, including Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge (1995), Dil To Pagal Hai (1997), Kuch Kuch Hota Hai (1998), Mohabbatein (2000), Kabhi Khushi Kabhie Gham... (2001), Kal Ho Naa Ho (2003), Veer-Zaara (2004) and Kabhi Alvida Naa Kehna (2006). He earned critical acclaim for his portrayal of an alcoholic in the period romantic drama Devdas (2002), a NASA scientist in the social drama Swades (2004), a hockey coach in the sports drama Chak De! India (2007), and a man with Asperger syndrome in the drama My Name Is Khan (2010). Further commercial successes came with the romances Om Shanti Om (2007) and Rab Ne Bana Di Jodi (2008), and with his expansion to comedies in Chennai Express (2013) and Happy New Year (2014). Following a brief setback and hiatus, Khan made a career comeback with the 2023 action thrillers Pathaan and Jawan, both of which rank among the highest-grossing Indian films.

As of 2015, Khan is co-chairman of the motion picture production company Red Chillies Entertainment and its subsidiaries and is the co-owner of the Indian Premier League cricket team Kolkata Knight Riders and the Caribbean Premier League team Trinbago Knight Riders. The media often label him as "Brand SRK" because of his many endorsements and entrepreneurship ventures. He is a frequent television presenter and stage show performer. Khan's philanthropic endeavours have provided health care and disaster relief, and he was honoured with UNESCO's Pyramide con Marni award in 2011 for his support of children's education and the World Economic Forum's Crystal Award in 2018 for advocating for women's and children's rights in India. He regularly features in listings of the most influential people in Indian culture, and in 2008, Newsweek named him one of their fifty most powerful people in the world. In 2022, Khan was voted one of the 50 greatest actors of all time in a readers' poll by Empire, and in 2023, Time named him as one of the most influential people in the world.

Early life and family
Parents
Khan's father, Mir Taj Mohammed Khan, was an Indian independence activist from Peshawar who campaigned alongside the Khudai Khidmatgar, a nonviolent resistance movement led by Abdul Ghaffar Khan that sought a united and independent India.[3][4] Mir was a follower of Abdul Ghaffar Khan,[5] and affiliated with the Indian National Congress.[6] He was also the cousin of the major general in the Indian National Army Shah Nawaz Khan.[d] According to Khan his paternal grandfather, Mir Jan Muhammad Khan, was an ethnic Pashtun (Pathan) from Afghanistan.[9][6][10] However, his paternal cousins in Peshawar later clarified that the family speaks Hindko and is originally from Kashmir, from where they settled in Peshawar centuries back, contradicting the claim that his grandfather was a Pashtun from Afghanistan.[6][11] As of 2010, Khan's paternal family was still living in the Shah Wali Qataal area of Peshawar's Qissa Khwani Bazaar.[6]

In 1946, Mir moved to Delhi to study law at Delhi University.[12] When the partition of India occurred in 1947, he was forced to stay in Delhi, and did not return to Peshawar until many years later.[13] Khan's mother, Lateef Fatima, a magistrate, was the daughter of a senior government engineer.[14][d][15] His parents were married in 1959.[16]

Early life
Khan was born on 2 November 1965 into a Muslim family in New Delhi.[17] He spent the first five years of his life in Mangalore, where his maternal grandfather, Iftikhar Ahmed, served as chief engineer of the port in the 1960s.[18][19][e] Khan has described himself on Twitter as "half Hyderabadi (mother), half Pathan (father), and some Kashmiri (grandmother)".[21]

Khan grew up in the Rajendra Nagar neighbourhood of New Delhi.[22] His father had several business ventures including a restaurant, and the family lived a middle-class life in rented apartments.[23] Khan attended St. Columba's School in central Delhi where he excelled in his studies and in sports such as hockey and football,[24] and received the school's highest award, the Sword of Honour.[23] Initially Khan aspired to pursue a career in sports, however owing to a shoulder injury in his early years meant that he could no longer play.[25] Instead, in his youth, he acted in stage plays and received praise for his imitations of Bollywood actors, of which his favourites were Dilip Kumar, Amitabh Bachchan, and Mumtaz.[26] One of his childhood friends and acting partners was Amrita Singh, who became a Bollywood actress.[27] Khan enrolled at Hansraj College (1985–88) to earn his bachelor's degree in economics, but spent much of his time at Delhi's Theatre Action Group (TAG),[28] where he studied acting under the mentorship of theatre director Barry John.[29][30] After Hansraj, he began studying for a master's degree in mass communication at Jamia Millia Islamia, but left to pursue his acting career.[31][32] He also attended the National School of Drama in Delhi during his early career in Bollywood.[33]

His father died of cancer in 1981,[f] and his mother died in 1991 from complications of diabetes.[36] After the death of their parents, his older sister, Shahnaz Lalarukh (born 1960)[37] fell into a depressed state and Khan took on the responsibility of caring for her.[34][38] Shahnaz continues to live with her brother and his family in their Mumbai mansion.[39]

Acting career

1988–1992: Television and film debut
Khan's first starring role was in Lekh Tandon's television series Dil Dariya, which began shooting in 1988, but production delays led to the Raj Kumar Kapoor directed 1989 series Fauji becoming his television debut instead.[40] In the series, which depicted a realistic look at the training of army cadets, he played the leading role of Abhimanyu Rai.[41][42] This led to further appearances in Aziz Mirza's television series Circus (1989–90) and Mani Kaul's miniseries Idiot (1992).[43] Khan also played minor parts in the serials Umeed (1989) and Wagle Ki Duniya (1988–90),[43] and in the English-language television film In Which Annie Gives It Those Ones (1989).[44] His appearances in these serials led critics to compare his look and acting style with those of the film actor Dilip Kumar,[45] but Khan was not interested in film acting at the time, thinking that he was not good enough.[43][46]

Khan changed his decision to act in films in April 1991,[47] citing it as a way to escape the grief of his mother's death.[48] He moved from Delhi to Mumbai to pursue a full-time career in Bollywood and was quickly signed to four films.[47] His first offer was for Hema Malini's directorial debut Dil Aashna Hai,[33][41] and by June, he had started his first shoot.[49] His film debut was in Deewana, which was released in June 1992.[50] In it he starred alongside Divya Bharti as the second male lead behind Rishi Kapoor. Deewana became a box office hit and launched Khan's Bollywood career;[51] he earned the Filmfare Best Male Debut Award for his performance.[52] Also released in 1992 were Khan's first films as the male lead, Chamatkar, Dil Aashna Hai, and the comedy Raju Ban Gaya Gentleman, which was his first of many collaborations with the actress Juhi Chawla.[53] His initial film roles saw him play characters who displayed energy and enthusiasm. According to Arnab Ray of Daily News and Analysis, Khan brought a new kind of acting as he was "sliding down stairs on a slab of ice, cartwheeling, somersaulting, lips trembling, eyes trembling, bringing to the screen the kind of physical energy ... visceral, intense, maniacal one moment and cloyingly boyish the next."[54]

1993–1994: Negative characters
Among his 1993 releases, Khan garnered the most appreciation for portraying villainous roles in two box office hits: a murderer in Baazigar, and an obsessive lover in Darr.[55] The former, in which Khan played an ambiguous avenger who murders his girlfriend, shocked Indian audiences with an unexpected violation of the standard Bollywood formula.[56] In The Cambridge Companion to Modern Indian Culture, Sonal Khullar called the character "the consummate anti-hero".[57] His performance in Baazigar, which would be his first of many appearances with actress Kajol, won Khan his first Filmfare Award for Best Actor.[58] In 2003, the Encyclopaedia of Hindi Cinema stated that Khan "defied the image of the conventional hero in both these films and created his own version of the revisionist hero".[58] Darr marked the first of Khan's many collaborations with filmmaker Yash Chopra and his company Yash Raj Films. Khan's stammering and the use of the phrase "I love you, K-k-k-Kiran" were popular with audiences.[59] Malini Mannath of The Indian Express argued that he "walks away with the acting honours in yet another negative role".[60] For Darr he received a nomination for the Filmfare Award for Best Performance in a Negative Role, also known as the Best Villain Award, but lost to Paresh Rawal for Sir.[61] Also in 1993, Khan performed a nude scene with Deepa Sahi in Maya Memsaab, although parts of it were censored by the Central Board of Film Certification.[62] The ensuing controversy prompted him to eschew such scenes in future roles.[63]

In 1994, Khan played a love-struck musician in Kundan Shah's comedy-drama film Kabhi Haan Kabhi Naa opposite Deepak Tijori and Suchitra Krishnamurthy, which he later professed was his favourite role. His performance earned him a Filmfare Critics Award for Best Performance, and in a retrospective review from 2004, Sukanya Verma of Rediff.com referred to it as Khan's best performance, calling him "spontaneous, vulnerable, boyish, mischievous and acting straight from the heart".[64] Also in 1994, Khan won the Filmfare Best Villain Award for his role as an obsessive lover in Anjaam, co-starring Madhuri Dixit.[58] At the time, playing antagonistic roles was considered risky to a leading man's career in mainstream Hindi cinema. Arnab Ray subsequently credited Khan for taking "insane risks" and "pushing the envelope" by choosing to play such characters, through which he established his career.[54] The director Mukul S. Anand called him "the new face of the industry" at the time.[48]

1995–1998: Romantic roles

Khan starred in seven films in 1995, the first of which was Rakesh Roshan's melodramatic thriller Karan Arjun. Co-starring Salman Khan and Kajol, it became the second-highest-grossing film of the year in India.[65] His most significant release that year was Aditya Chopra's directorial debut, the romance Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge, in which he played a young Non-resident Indian (NRI) who falls in love with Kajol's character during a trip across Europe. Khan was initially reticent to portray the role of a lover, but this film is credited with establishing him as a "romantic hero".[66] Lauded by both critics and the public, it became the year's highest grossing production in India and abroad and was declared an "all time blockbuster" by Box Office India,[65][67] with an estimated lifetime gross of ₹2 billion (US$61.68 million) worldwide.[68][69] It is the longest-running film in the history of Indian cinema; it is still showing at the Maratha Mandir theatre in Mumbai after more than 1000 weeks as of early 2015.[70][71] The film won ten Filmfare Awards, including the second of Khan's Best Actor Awards.[58] The director and critic Raja Sen said, "Khan gives a fabulous performance, redefining the lover for the 1990s with great panache. He's cool and flippant, but sincere enough to appeal to the [audience]. The performance itself is, like the best in the business, played well enough to come across as effortless, as non-acting."[72]

In 1996, all four of Khan's releases failed critically and commercially,[73] but the following year, his starring role opposite Aditya Pancholi and Juhi Chawla in Aziz Mirza's romantic comedy Yes Boss earned him accolades that included a Filmfare Best Actor nomination.[61] Later in 1997, he starred in Subhash Ghai's diasporic-themed social drama Pardes,[74] portraying Arjun, a musician facing a moral dilemma. India Today cites it as one of the first major Bollywood pictures to succeed in the United States.[75] Khan's final release of 1997 was the second collaboration with Yash Chopra in the popular musical romance Dil To Pagal Hai. He portrayed Rahul, a stage director caught in a love triangle between Madhuri Dixit and Karisma Kapoor. The film and his performance met with critical praise, winning Khan his third Best Actor Award at Filmfare.[58]

Khan performed the lead role in three films and made one special appearance in 1998. In his first release of the year, he played a double role opposite Juhi Chawla and Sonali Bendre in Mahesh Bhatt's action comedy Duplicate, the first of his many collaborations with Yash Johar's production company Dharma Productions. The film was not well received,[76] but India Today lauded Khan for his energetic performance.[77] The same year, Khan won critical praise for his performance as an All India Radio correspondent who develops an infatuation for a mysterious terrorist (Manisha Koirala) in Dil Se..,[78] the third instalment of Mani Ratnam's trilogy of terror films.[79][80] In his final release of the year, he portrayed a college student in Karan Johar's romance Kuch Kuch Hota Hai, in which he was involved in a love triangle along with Kajol and Rani Mukerji. The writer Anjana Motihar Chandra has referred to the picture as the blockbuster of the 1990s, a "pot-pourri of romance, comedy, and entertainment."[81] Khan won the Best Actor award at the Filmfare Awards ceremony for the second consecutive year,[58] although he and several critics believed his performance to have been overshadowed by that of Kajol.[82]

The roles in this phase of his career, and the series of romantic comedies and family dramas that followed, earned Khan widespread adulation from audiences, particularly teenagers,[83] and according to the author Anupama Chopra, established him as an icon of romance in India.[84][85] He continued to have frequent professional associations with Yash Chopra, Aditya Chopra, and Karan Johar, who moulded his image and made him into a superstar.[86] Khan became a romantic leading man without ever actually kissing any of his co-stars,[84] although he broke this rule in 2012, after strong urging by Yash Chopra.[87]

1999–2003: Career fluctuations

Khan in 2000
Khan's only release in 1999 was Baadshah, in which he starred opposite Twinkle Khanna. Although the film underperformed at the box office,[88] it earned him a Filmfare Award nomination for Best Performance in a Comic Role, which he lost to Govinda for Haseena Maan Jaayegi.[61] Khan became a producer in 1999 in a collaboration with the actress Juhi Chawla and the director Aziz Mirza for a production company called Dreamz Unlimited.[89] The company's first production, Phir Bhi Dil Hai Hindustani (2000), starring Khan and Chawla, was a commercial failure.[90] It was released one week after Kaho Naa... Pyaar Hai, starring Hrithik Roshan, then a newcomer, who critics believed overshadowed Khan.[91] Swapna Mitter of Rediff.com spoke of Khan's predictable mannerisms, saying "Frankly, it's high time he innovated his act a little."[92] Khan did a supporting role in Kamal Haasan's Hey Ram (2000), which was made simultaneously in Tamil and Hindi. He thereby made his Tamil debut by playing the role of an archaeologist named Amjad Khan.[93] He performed free of charge as he wanted to work with Haasan.[94][95] On Khan's performance, T. Krithika Reddy of The Hindu wrote, "Shah Rukh Khan, as usual comes up with an impeccable performance."[93]

In 2001, Dreamz Unlimited attempted a comeback with Khan portraying the title role in Santosh Sivan's historical epic Aśoka, a partly fictionalised account of the life of emperor Ashoka. The film was screened at the Venice Film Festival and the 2001 Toronto International Film Festival to a positive response,[96] but it performed poorly at Indian box offices.[97] As losses continued to mount for the production company,[91] Khan was forced to close srkworld.com, a company that he had started along with Dreamz Unlimited.[98] In December 2001, Khan suffered a spinal injury while performing an action sequence for a special appearance in Krishna Vamsi's Shakti: The Power.[99] He was subsequently diagnosed with a prolapsed disc, and attempted multiple alternative therapies. None of these provided a permanent solution to the injury, which caused him severe pain while shooting several of his films.[99][100] By the beginning of 2003, his condition had worsened to the point that he had to undergo anterior cervical discectomy and fusion surgery at Wellington Hospital, London.[101][102][103] Khan resumed shooting in June 2003, but he reduced his workload and the number of film roles he accepted annually.[100]

Successes during this time included Aditya Chopra's Mohabbatein (2000), and Karan Johar's family drama Kabhi Khushi Kabhie Gham... (2001),[90][104] which Khan cites as a turning point in his career.[105] Both films co-starred Amitabh Bachchan as an authoritarian figure, and presented ideological struggles between the two men.[106][107] Khan's performances in the films were met with wide public appreciation, and he was awarded his second Filmfare Critics Award for Best Actor for Mohabbatein.[61][108] Kabhi Khushi Kabhie Gham... remained the top-grossing Indian production of all time in the overseas market for the next five years.[109]

In 2002, Khan played the title role as a rebellious alcoholic opposite Aishwarya Rai and Madhuri Dixit in Sanjay Leela Bhansali's period romance Devdas. At a cost of over ₹500 million (US$10.29 million), it was the most expensive Bollywood film ever made at the time,[110] and became a box office success, earning approximately ₹1.68 billion ($35 million) worldwide.[111] The film earned numerous accolades including 10 Filmfare Awards, with Best Actor for Khan,[52] and a BAFTA Award for Best Film Not in the English Language.[112] Khan next starred in Kal Ho Naa Ho (2003), a comedy-drama written by Karan Johar and set in New York City, which became the second-highest-grossing film domestically and the top-grossing Bollywood film in external markets that year.[104][113] Co-starring with Jaya Bachchan, Saif Ali Khan, and Preity Zinta, Khan received critical praise for his portrayal of Aman Mathur, a man with a fatal heart disease, with critics praising his emotional impact upon audiences.[114] Conflict broke out between Khan and the other partners of Dreamz Unlimited over the failure to cast Juhi Chawla in their 2003 production of Aziz Mirza's Chalte Chalte, and they parted ways, despite the film's success.[115]

2004–2009: Comeback
2004 was a critically and commercially successful year for Khan. He transformed Dreamz Unlimited into Red Chillies Entertainment, adding his wife Gauri as a producer.[116] In the company's first production, he starred in Farah Khan's directorial debut, the masala film Main Hoon Na. A fictionalised account of India–Pakistan relations, it was viewed by some commentators as a conscious effort to move away from the stereotypical portrayal of Pakistan as the constant villain.[117] Khan then played an Indian Air Force pilot who falls in love with a Pakistani woman (Preity Zinta) in Yash Chopra's romance film Veer-Zaara, which was screened at the 55th Berlin Film Festival to critical praise.[118] It was the highest earning film of 2004 in India, with a worldwide gross of over ₹940 million (US$20.74 million), and Main Hoon Na was the second-highest earner with ₹680 million (US$15.01 million).[109][119]

In his final release of 2004, Khan starred as a NASA scientist who patriotically returns to India to rekindle his roots in Ashutosh Gowariker's social drama Swades (meaning "Homeland"), which became the first Indian picture to be shot inside the NASA research centre at the Kennedy Space Center in Florida.[120] Film scholar Stephen Teo refers to the picture as an example of "Bollywoodised realism", displaying a transcendence in conventional narrative and audience expectation in Hindi cinema.[121] In December 2013, The Times of India reported that Khan found filming the picture such an emotionally overwhelming and life-changing experience that he had still not viewed the film.[122] Derek Elley of Variety found Khan's performance "unsettling" as "a self-satisfied expatriate determined to bring Western values to poor Indian peasants",[123] but several film critics, including Jitesh Pillai, believed it to have been his finest acting to date.[124][125] He was nominated for the Filmfare Best Actor Award for all three of his 2004 releases and eventually won the award for Swades.[52][61] Filmfare later included his performance in the 2010 issue of Bollywood's "Top 80 Iconic Performances".[126]

In 2005, Khan starred in Amol Palekar's fantasy drama, Paheli. The film was India's submission for the Best Foreign Language Film at the 79th Academy Awards.[127] He later collaborated with Karan Johar for the third time in the musical romantic drama Kabhi Alvida Naa Kehna (2006), in which he played an unhappily married man who has an extramarital affair with a married woman. The film, which featured an ensemble cast including Amitabh Bachchan, Abhishek Bachchan, Rani Mukerji, Preity Zinta and Kirron Kher, emerged as India's highest-grossing film in the overseas market,[104] earning more than ₹1.13 billion (US$25.62 million) worldwide.[109] Both his roles in Kabhi Alvida Naa Kehna and the action film Don, a remake of the 1978 film of the same name, earned Khan Best Actor nominations at the Filmfare Awards,[128] despite his performance as the titular character in Don being negatively compared to that of Amitabh Bachchan in the original film.[129][130]

"Such great things have happened to such a normal guy like me. I am a nobody who shouldn't have been able to do all this but I have done it. I tell everyone that there's this myth I work for; there is this myth called Shahrukh Khan and I am his employee. I have to live up to that ... I'll do it, I am an actor. But I can't start believing in this myth."

 —Khan reflecting in 2007 on his position as the Hindi film industry's top star[131]

In 2007, Khan portrayed a disgraced hockey player who coached the Indian women's national hockey team to World Cup success in Yash Raj Films' semi-fictional Chak De! India. Bhaichand Patel notes that Khan, who had a background in the sport playing for his university's hockey team,[132] essentially portrayed himself as a "cosmopolitan, liberal, Indian Muslim".[133] Faring well in both India and abroad,[109][134] Khan garnered another Filmfare Award for Best Actor for his performance,[52] which Rajeev Masand of CNN-IBN considers to have been "without any of his typical trappings, without any of his trademark quirks", portraying Kabir Khan "like a real flesh-and-blood human being".[135] Filmfare included his performance in their 2010 issue of the "Top 80 Iconic Performances".[136] In the same year, Khan starred alongside Arjun Rampal, Deepika Padukone and Shreyas Talpade in Farah Khan's reincarnation melodrama Om Shanti Om, portraying a 1970s junior artiste who is reborn as a 2000s era superstar. The film became the highest grossing Indian motion picture of 2007, both domestically and abroad.[104][137] Om Shanti Om earned Khan his second nomination of the year for Best Actor at Filmfare.[138] Khalid Mohammed from Hindustan Times wrote, "the enterprise belongs to Shah Rukh Khan, who tackles comedy, high drama and action with his signature style—spontaneous and intuitively intelligent".[139]

Khan collaborated for the third time with Aditya Chopra on the romantic comedy Rab Ne Bana Di Jodi (2008) opposite Anushka Sharma, at that time a newcomer. He played Surinder Sahni, a shy man with low self-esteem, whose love for his young arranged wife (Sharma) causes him to transform himself into Raj, a boisterous alter-ego. Rachel Saltz of The New York Times believed the dual role to have been "tailor-made" for Khan, allowing him to display his talents,[140] although Deep Contractor from Epilogue thought Khan displayed greater strength in the role of Surinder and weakness in the role of monologue-prone Raj.[141] In December 2008, Khan suffered a shoulder injury while filming a small role in Mudassar Aziz's Dulha Mil Gaya. He underwent extensive physiotherapy sessions at the time but the pain left him almost immobile and he had arthroscopic surgery in February 2009.[142][143] He performed a special appearance in the 2009 film Billu, playing Bollywood superstar Sahir Khan—a fictionalised version of himself, wherein he performed musical item numbers with actresses Kareena Kapoor, Priyanka Chopra, and Deepika Padukone.[144] As head of the film's production company, Red Chillies, Khan made the call to change the title of the film from Billu Barber to Billu after hairdressers across the country complained that the word "barber" was derogatory. The company covered up the offending word on billboards that had already been installed with the original title.[145]

2010–2014: Expansion to action and comedy

After refusing the role that subsequently went to Anil Kapoor in Danny Boyle's Slumdog Millionaire (2008), Khan began shooting My Name Is Khan (2010), his fourth collaboration with director Karan Johar and his sixth with Kajol.[146] The film is based on a true story and set against the backdrop of perceptions of Islam after the 11 September attacks. Khan plays Rizwan Khan, a Muslim suffering from mild Asperger syndrome who sets out on a journey across America to meet the country's president, in a role that film scholar Stephen Teo sees as a "symbol of assertive rasa values" and another example of Khan representing NRI identity in global Bollywood.[147] To provide an accurate portrayal of a sufferer without disparagement, Khan spent several months researching his role by reading books, watching videos and talking to people affected by the condition.[148][149] Upon release, My Name is Khan became one of the highest grossing Bollywood films of all time outside India,[109][104] and earned Khan his eighth Filmfare Award for Best Actor,[52] equalling the record for the most wins in the category with actor Dilip Kumar.[150] Jay Wesissberg from Variety noted how Khan portrayed the Asperger's sufferer with "averted eyes, springy steps, [and] stuttered repetitions of memorized texts", believing it to have been a "standout performance sure to receive the Autism Society's gold seal of approval".[151]

In 2011, Khan starred alongside Arjun Rampal and Kareena Kapoor in Anubhav Sinha's superhero film Ra.One, his first work in this subgenre, as a favour to his children.[152] The film follows the story of a London-based videogame designer who creates a villainous character who escapes into the real world. It was billed as Bollywood's most expensive production; it had an estimated budget of ₹1.25 billion (US$26.78 million).[153][154] Despite negative media coverage of the film's box office performance, Ra.One was a financial success with a gross of ₹2.4 billion (US$51.42 million).[155][156] The film, and Khan's portrayal of a dual role, received mixed reviews; while most critics praised his performance as the robotic superhero G.One, though they criticised his portrayal of the videogame designer Shekhar.[157] Khan's second release of 2011 was Don 2, a sequel to Don (2006).[158] To prepare for his role, Khan exercised extensively and performed most of the stunts himself.[159] His performance earned him positive reviews from critics; Nikhat Kazmi of The Times of India said, "Shah Rukh remains in command and never loses his foothold, neither through the dramatic sequences nor through the action cuts".[160] The year's highest grossing Bollywood production abroad,[161][162] it was showcased at the 62nd Berlin International Film Festival.[163]

Khan's only release in 2012 was Yash Chopra's last picture,[164] the romantic drama Jab Tak Hai Jaan, which saw him once again in a romantic role, starring opposite Katrina Kaif and Anushka Sharma. CNN-IBN considered the overall performance by Khan to have been one of his finest to date, but believed that Khan's first screen kiss of his career with Katrina Kaif, twenty years his junior, was an awkward one.[87][165] Jab Tak Hai Jaan was a moderate financial success earning over ₹2.11 billion (US$39.49 million) worldwide.[166][167] The film was showcased at the 2012 Marrakech International Film Festival in Morocco, along with Kabhi Khushi Kabhie Gham..., Veer-Zaara, and Don 2.[168] At the following Zee Cine Awards, Khan performed a tribute to the late Yash Chopra along with Kaif, Sharma, and several of Chopra's other past heroines.[169]

In 2013, Khan starred in Rohit Shetty's action comedy Chennai Express for Red Chillies Entertainment, a film which earned mixed critical reviews and a fair amount of criticism for its perceived disparagement of South Indian culture, although the film included a tribute to Tamil cinema star Rajinikanth.[170] The critic Khalid Mohamed thought that Khan overacted in the film and criticised him for "re-rendering every old trick in the acting book".[171] Despite the criticism, the film broke many box office records for Hindi films in both India and abroad, surpassing 3 Idiots to briefly become the highest grossing Bollywood film of all time, with a gross of almost ₹4 billion (US$68.26 million) in worldwide ticket sales.[172][173] On International Women's Day in 2013, The Times of India reported that Khan had requested a new convention with the name of his lead female co-stars appearing above his own in the credits. He claimed that the women in his life, including his co-stars, have been the reason for his success.[174] In 2014, the actor was featured in Farah Khan's ensemble action comedy Happy New Year, which co-starred Deepika Padukone, Abhishek Bachchan and Boman Irani; his third collaboration with the director.[175] Although Khan's unidimensional character was criticised,[176] the film became a major commercial success grossing ₹3.8 billion (US$64.85 million) worldwide.[177][178][179]

2015–2022: Career setbacks and hiatus

Khan in 2017
Khan next appeared alongside Kajol, Varun Dhawan and Kriti Sanon in Rohit Shetty's action comedy Dilwale (2015). The film garnered mixed reviews, though it was financially profitable with a gross of ₹3.7 billion (US$57.68 million).[180] Namrata Joshi of The Hindu commented, "With Dilwale, Rohit Shetty goes hopelessly wrong despite much that he had at his disposal, including a power-packed cast and producer", and felt that the attempt to repackage Khan and Kajol had backfired.[181] He then took on dual parts of a superstar and his doppelgänger fan in Maneesh Sharma's action thriller Fan (2016). Peter Bradshaw of The Guardian considered the film to be "exhausting, bizarre yet watchable" and thought that Khan was aptly "creepy" as the obsessive admirer.[182] The film underperformed at the box office, and trade journalists attributed this failure to the film's non-conformity to mainstream formula.[183] Later that year, Khan portrayed the supporting part of a therapist to an aspiring cinematographer (Alia Bhatt) in Gauri Shinde's coming-of-age film Dear Zindagi.[184]

In Rahul Dholakia's action crime film Raees (2017), Khan took on the part of the titular anti-hero—a bootlegger turned mobster in 1980s Gujarat. In a typical mixed review, Pratim D. Gupta of The Telegraph thought Khan's performance to be "inconsistent, intense and power-packed at times, but often slipping out of character into his usual mix of stock mannerisms".[185] Commercially, the film was a modest success, earning about ₹3.08 billion (US$47.3 million) worldwide.[186][187] Khan returned to the romantic genre with the role of a tourist guide who falls in love with a traveller (Anushka Sharma) in Imtiaz Ali's Jab Harry Met Sejal (2017). In a review for Mint, Uday Bhatia criticised Khan's pairing with Sharma, 22 years his junior, writing that Khan had performed "similar gestures of love decades ago to actors his own age".[188] He reunited with Sharma and Katrina Kaif in Aanand L Rai's romantic drama Zero (2018), in which he played Bauua Singh, a dwarf involved in a love triangle.[189][190] The film received mixed reviews with praise directed to Khan's performance.[191][192] Writing for Hindustan Times, Raja Sen commended his "dominating performance and tremendous energy" and Anna M. M. Vetticad of Firstpost called him an "excellent fit" for the role for allowing his "naturally energetic personality, comic timing and charm to take flight".[193][194] Both Jab Harry Met Sejal and Zero were box office flops.[195][196]

According to a Box Office India report, Khan's stardom was impacted by his films failing to do well.[197] Following the release of Zero, Khan took a four-year break from full-time acting, which was partly caused by the COVID-19 pandemic in India. He took the time off to attempt a career comeback.[198] During this period, he made extended special appearances in the 2022 films Brahmāstra: Part One – Shiva and Rocketry: The Nambi Effect.[199]

2023–present: Resurgence
In 2023, Khan reunited with Yash Raj Films in the action thriller Pathaan (2023), set in the YRF Spy Universe, in which he played an exiled field agent assigned to stop a terrorist attack in India.[200] Critic Sukanya Verma took note of Khan's "weathered intensity, grizzly charisma and trademark wit", while Kaveree Bamzai termed it a "much-needed makeover" of an ageing Khan into an action star.[201][202] Pathaan broke several box-office records, thus re-establishing Khan's stardom.[203][204] Khan took on another action film role in the same year in Atlee's Jawan, playing father and son doppelgängers.[205] Nandini Ramnath of Scroll.in wrote that "Khan's screen image – expansive, suffused with love, heroic in an old-fashioned way without being aggressively macho, irreverent but also sincere – helps sell a conceit that might have crashed with any other actor".[206] Jawan broke the records set by Pathaan.[207] Both films grossed over ₹10 billion (US$120 million) to rank, respectively, as Hindi cinema's second and third biggest grossers worldwide,[208] making Khan the first Indian actor to deliver two films that earned over ₹10 billion.[209]

In his final release of 2023, Khan starred in Rajkumar Hirani's Dunki, a social drama about an illegal immigration technique named donkey flight.[210][211] Uday Bhatia wrote that his role as a "romantic feminist soldier patriot friend" marked "a break from Khan the action star but offers no respite from the Khan the perfect screen idol".[212] Grossing over ₹4 billion (US$48 million), Dunki emerged as Khan's third consecutive commercial success of the year, although it did not match up to the record grosses of Pathaan or Jawan.[213][214]

Other work
Film production and television hosting

At the 61st Filmfare Awards in 2016, which Khan hosted along with Kapil Sharma
Khan co-produced three films from 1999 to 2003 as a founding member of the partnership Dreamz Unlimited.[89] After the partnership was dissolved, he and Gauri restructured the company as Red Chillies Entertainment,[116] which includes divisions dealing with film and television production, visual effects, and advertising.[215] As of 2015, the company has produced or co-produced at least nine films.[216] Either Khan or Gauri are usually given production credits, and he has appeared in most of the films, either in the lead role, or in a guest appearance. Khan was involved in several aspects of the making of Ra.One (2011). Aside from acting, he produced the film, volunteered to write the console game script, dubbed for it, oversaw its technical development, and wrote the digital comics based on the film's characters.[217][218] Khan has occasionally done playback singing for his films. In Josh (2000) he sang the popular song "Apun Bola Tu Meri Laila". He also sang in Don (2006) and Jab Tak Hai Jaan (2012).[219] For Always Kabhi Kabhi (2011), which was produced by Red Chillies, Khan participated in the lyrical composition.[220]

In addition to his early television serial appearances, Khan has hosted numerous televised awards shows, including the Filmfare, Zee Cine, and Screen Awards.[221][222][223] In 2007, he replaced Amitabh Bachchan for one season as the host of Kaun Banega Crorepati, the Indian version of Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?,[224] and a year later, Khan began hosting Kya Aap Paanchvi Pass Se Tez Hain?, the Indian version of Are You Smarter Than a 5th Grader?.[225] In 2011, he returned to television, appearing on Imagine TV's Zor Ka Jhatka: Total Wipeout, the Indian version of Wipeout; scenes featuring Khan were shot at the Yash Raj Studios in Mumbai.[226] Contrary to his earlier television anchoring jobs, Zor Ka Jhatka: Total Wipeout performed poorly. It aired for only one season and became the lowest rated show hosted by a Bollywood star.[226] In 2017, Khan began hosting TED Talks India Nayi Soch, a talk show produced by TED Conferences, LLC which started aired on STAR Plus.[227]

Stage performances
Khan is a frequent stage performer and has participated in several world tours and concerts. In 1997, he performed in Asha Bhosle's Moments in Time concert in Malaysia, and returned the following year to perform with Karisma Kapoor for the Shahrukh–Karisma: Live in Malaysia concert.[228] The same year, he participated in The Awesome Foursome world tour across the United Kingdom, Canada, and the United States along with Juhi Chawla, Akshay Kumar and Kajol, and resumed the tour in Malaysia the following year.[229][230] In 2002, Khan featured with Amitabh Bachchan, Aamir Khan, Preity Zinta, and Aishwarya Rai in the show From India With Love at Manchester's Old Trafford and London's Hyde Park; the event was attended by more than 100,000 people.[231] Khan performed alongside Rani Mukherji, Arjun Rampal and Ishaa Koppikar in a 2010 concert at the St. Joseph High School field in Dhaka, Bangladesh.[232] The next year he joined Shahid Kapoor and Priyanka Chopra in the Friendship Concert, celebrating 150 years of India–South Africa friendship in Durban, South Africa.[233]

Khan started an association with the "Temptations" series of concert tours by singing, dancing, and performing skits alongside Arjun Rampal, Priyanka Chopra, and other Bollywood stars in Temptations 2004, a stage show that toured 22 venues across the world.[234] The show played to 15,000 spectators at Dubai's Festival City Arena.[235] In 2008, Khan set up Temptation Reloaded, a series of concerts that toured several countries, including the Netherlands.[236] Another tour was held with Bipasha Basu and others in 2012 in Jakarta,[237] and in 2013 another series of concerts visited Auckland, Perth and Sydney.[238] In 2014, Khan performed in SLAM! The Tour in the US, Canada, and London,[239] and also hosted the Indian premiere of the live talent show, Got Talent World Stage Live.[240]

Ownership of Kolkata Knight Riders
In 2008, Khan, in partnership with Juhi Chawla and her husband Jay Mehta, acquired ownership rights for the franchise representing Kolkata in the Twenty20 cricket tournament Indian Premier League (IPL) for US$75.09 million, and named the team Kolkata Knight Riders (KKR).[241] As of 2009, KKR was one of the richest teams in the IPL, with a brand value of US$42.1 million.[242] The team performed poorly on the field during the first three years.[243] Their performance improved over time, and they became the champions for the first time in 2012[243] and repeated the feat in 2014.[244] The Knight Riders hold the record for the longest winning streak by any Indian team in T20s (14).[245] They won their third IPL title in the 2024 edition.[246]

Khan performed alongside Sunidhi Chauhan and Shriya Saran at the opening ceremony of the IPL 2011 season, where they danced to Tamil songs.[247] He appeared again in 2013 alongside Katrina Kaif, Deepika Padukone and Pitbull.[248] In May 2012, the Mumbai Cricket Association (MCA) banned him from the Wankhede Stadium for five years for getting into an argument with the security staff after a match between KKR and the Mumbai Indians.[249] Khan had, however, stated that he acted only after children, including his daughter, were being "manhandled" by the security staff[249][250] and that the officials were extremely high-handed and aggressive in their behaviour,[251] he had been abused with communal indecent comment.[250] Later MCA officials had accused him of being drunk in one version of the story, hitting the guard and of completely uncharacteristically abusing a female supporter of Mumbai Indians after the match in another version of the story, which Khan had maintained it was done to support their action and for cheap publicity.[250][252][253] Wankhede guard later contradicted MCA officials' claim and said Shah Rukh Khan had not hit him.[250] Khan later apologised to his fans after his team won the final match.[254] MCA revoked the ban in 2015[255] and in 2016, Mumbai Police informed that no 'cognisable offence' was made out against Khan and they had come to the conclusion that Shah Rukh Khan was not drunk and did not use abusive language before minors at the Wankhede Stadium in 2012.[252][253]

In the media

Khan receives a considerable amount of media coverage in India, and is often referred to as "King Khan", "The Baadshah of Bollywood", or "The King of Bollywood".[b] Anupama Chopra cites him as an "ever present celebrity", with two or three films a year, constantly running television ads, print ads, and gigantic billboards lining the streets of Indian cities.[261] He is the object of a sometimes fanatical following, with a fan base estimated to exceed one billion.[262] Newsweek named Khan as one of their fifty most powerful people globally in 2008 and called him "the world's biggest movie star".[263][264] In 2011 he was described as "the biggest movie star you've never heard of...perhaps the world's biggest movie star, period" by Steven Zeitchik of the Los Angeles Times[g][266] and has been called the world's biggest movie star in other international media outlets.[c] According to a popularity survey, 3.2 billion people around the world know Khan, more than who know Tom Cruise.[270] In a 2022 readers' poll by Empire magazine, Khan was listed as one of the 50 greatest actors of all time. The magazine attributed his success to the "outrageous amounts of [his] charisma and absolute mastery of [his] craft. Comfortable in almost every genre going, there's pretty much nothing he can't do."[271] In 2023, Time magazine named him one of the 100 most influential people in the world,[272] and he topped the list per a readers poll.[273]

Khan is one of the wealthiest celebrities in India, topping the Forbes India's "Celebrity 100 list" in 2012, 2013 and 2015.[274][275][276] His wealth has been estimated at US$400–600 million.[277][278] Khan owns several properties in India and abroad, including a £20 million apartment in London,[279] and a villa on the Palm Jumeirah in Dubai.[280] From 2023–2024, Khan ranked as the highest tax payer in India.[281]

Khan frequently appears on listings of the most popular, stylish and influential people in India. He has regularly featured among the top ten on The Times of India's list of the 50 most desirable men in India,[282][283] and in a 2007 poll by the magazine Eastern Eye he was named the sexiest man in Asia.[284] Khan is often referred to as "Brand SRK" by media organisations because of his many brand endorsement and entrepreneurship ventures.[285][286] He is one of the highest paid Bollywood endorsers and one of the most visible celebrities in television advertising, with up to a six per cent share of the television advertisement market.[287][288] Khan has endorsed brands including Pepsi, Nokia, Hyundai, Dish TV, D'decor, LUX and TAG Heuer.[288][289] Books have been published about him,[290][291] and his popularity has been documented in several non-fiction films, including the two-part documentary The Inner and Outer World of Shah Rukh Khan (2005),[292] and the Discovery Travel & Living channel's ten-part miniseries Living with a Superstar—Shah Rukh Khan (2010).[287] In 2007, Khan became the third Indian actor to have his wax statue installed at London's Madame Tussauds museum, after Aishwarya Rai and Amitabh Bachchan.[293][294] Additional versions of the statue were installed at Madame Tussauds' museums in Los Angeles, Hong Kong, New York and Washington.[295]

Khan has been brand ambassador of various governmental campaigns, including Pulse Polio and the National AIDS Control Organisation.[289] He is a member of the board of directors of the Make-A-Wish Foundation in India,[296] and in 2011 he was appointed by UNOPS as the first global ambassador of the Water Supply and Sanitation Collaborative Council.[297] He has recorded a series of public service announcements championing good health and proper nutrition, and joined India's Health Ministry and UNICEF in a nationwide child immunisation campaign.[298] In 2011, he received UNESCO's Pyramide con Marni award for his charitable commitment to provide education for children, becoming the first Indian to win the accolade.[299] In 2014, Khan became the ambassador for Interpol's campaign "Turn Back Crime".[300] In 2015, Khan received a privileged degree from the University of Edinburgh, Scotland.[301] In 2018, Khan was honoured by the World Economic Forum with their annual Crystal Award for his leadership in championing children's and women's rights in India.[302][303]

In October 2019, Khan featured in a video launched by Prime Minister Narendra Modi to pay tribute to Mahatma Gandhi on his 150th birth anniversary. The preview of the video, which took place on 20 October 2019 at PMO, was attended by Khan, along with Aamir Khan, Kangana Ranaut, Rajkumar Hirani, Jacqueline Fernandez, Sonam Kapoor, Ekta Kapoor, Varun Sharma, Jackie Shroff, Imtiaz Ali, Sonu Nigam, Kapil Sharma, and many other dignitaries.[304][305][306] Khan's distinctive voice and mannerisms have inspired many imitators and voice actors.[307] In the Hindi-dubbed version of the cartoon series Oggy and the Cockroaches, Saurav Chakrabarti emulates Khan's voice for the character Oggy.[308]

In April 2020, Khan announced a series of initiatives to help the government of India and the state governments of Maharashtra, West Bengal and Delhi mitigate the COVID-19 pandemic as well as relief measures for thousands of underprivileged people and daily wage labourers affected by the lockdown.[309][310] He offered his 4-storey personal office space to the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation to be used as a quarantine centre for coronavirus patients.[311]

Khan married Gauri Chibber, a Punjabi Hindu, in a traditional Hindu wedding ceremony on 25 October 1991, after a six-year courtship.[321][322] They have a son Aryan (born 1997)[323] and a daughter Suhana (born 2000).[324] In 2013, they became parents of a third child[325] who was born through a surrogate mother.[326] Both his elder children have expressed interest in entering the entertainment industry; Khan has stated that Aryan, who studied filmmaking at the USC School of Cinematic Arts in California, aspires to become a writer-director,[327][328] while Suhana, who served as assistant director for Khan's film Zero (2018), is studying drama and acting at NYU's Tisch School of the Arts for higher education.[329][330] Suhana made her acting debut in November 2019, in a short film titled "The Grey Part of Blue."[331] According to Khan, while he strongly believes in Islam, he also values his wife's religion. His children follow both religions; at his home the Qur'an is situated next to the murti of Hindu deities.[332]

 Although Shahrukh Khan's mother was reported to be the adopted daughter of Shah Nawaz Khan, a major general in the Indian National Army, the Indian Army denied those reports.[7] According to Khan, his father was related to Shah Nawaz.[8]
 There was some confusion because Khan seemingly contradicted himself in an interview, saying that he was born and brought up in Mangalore[20] but he later confirmed his birthplace as Delhi, and that he was brought up in Mangalore for the first five years.[19]
 Chopra's 2007 book gave the date as 19 September 1980,[34] but in an interview in 2014 Khan said the date was 19 October 1981.[35]
 Although Khan has an estimated worldwide fan base exceeding one billion, the bulk of his fan base, like numerous other Bollywood stars, is in Asia and Indian diaspora communities worldwide, whereas Zeitchik was writing for an American audience in the Los Angeles Times.[265]

Oggy and the Cockroaches: Next Generation
Oggy and the Cockroaches (French: Oggy et les Cafards) is a French animated television series created by Jean-Yves Raimbaud and produced by Gaumont Multimedia for seasons 1–2 and Xilam Animation for seasons 3–7. The series chronicles the exploits and adventures of Oggy, a blue cat whose life is constantly interrupted by three cockroaches – Dee Dee, Marky, and Joey respectively – who love to cause mischief within his home. The show employs silent comedy: characters either do not speak or use unintelligible vocalizations and gestures. The show premiered in September 1998 on France 3, and later expanded internationally. The series ended in January 2019, having released seven seasons in over two decades.[citation needed] The cartoon also relies on slapstick humour much like its inspiration and spiritual predecessor "Tom and Jerry".[3] only amplifying the level of extremities up a notch; while "traditional" slapstick cartoon characters prefer dropping anvils and pianos on each other, this show sometimes uses atomic bombs or submarines.

In September 2020, a reboot series was announced, entitled Oggy and the Cockroaches: Next Generation, in which Oggy takes care of Piya, a young elephant from India.[4][5] It was released worldwide on Netflix on 28 July 2022. Although it differs noticeably from the original in terms of its visuals and tone, Gulli labels it as Oggy's eighth season.[citation needed]

Synopsis
Oggy, an anthropomorphic cat, would prefer to spend his days watching television and eating but is continually pestered by three roaches: Joey, Marky and Dee Dee. The cockroaches' slapstick mischief ranges from plundering Oggy's refrigerator to hijacking the train he just boarded. In many situations, Oggy is also helped by Jack, who is more violent and short-tempered than him and is also annoyed by the cockroaches. Bob, a short-tempered bulldog, also appears in the show and is Oggy's neighbor.

Characters

Artwork depicting all main characters
Some of the characters make a cameo in Xilam's other shows, such as Zig & Sharko and The Daltons and in the film, Go West! A Lucky Luke Adventure. The eponymous characters make a debut in the Space Goofs episode "Venus Junior", where they are seen on the aliens' television (before the pilot episode was officially posted online, in 2016). In the second season, "Space Sailors" has a gag where the cockroaches greet Etno (in the aliens' now-flooded house), as they row by. Oggy, the cockroaches and Jack appear as drawings in "Doodle", and Oggy and Monica make a cameo in the episode "The Alien Show".[citation needed]

Main
Oggy is a cat with a light blue body, green eyes, red nose, grey tummy and white feet. Oggy also has a black "cap" (shaped to include his ears) over the top of his head. Oggy usually spends his time either watching TV or doing housework, when he's not chasing the cockroaches. Despite the constant mayhem caused by the cockroaches, Oggy has developed a sort of love–hate relationship with them, having lived with them for a long time. Whenever he finds himself alone in his house, he will eventually begin to miss the cockroaches along with their pranks (as seen in the episode "Priceless Roaches" and "So Lonely"/"Alone at last") followed by nothing interesting happening in his life. According to executive producer Marc du Pontavice and France Info, Oggy was named after punk rock musician Iggy Pop[6] and the rock album The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars.[7][8] In the first three seasons, Oggy, like his Tom and Jerry counterpart was the main punching bag in the series, though that was phased out in the fourth and fifth seasons. He also has a fear of heights, as shown in "The Rise & the Fall"/"Vertigo" – however, it only applied for Jack's construction site.
The Cockroaches are a trio of cockroaches named Dee Dee, Marky and Joey (who are implied to be named after members of the rock band The Ramones), who love playing tricks on Oggy and the other characters, like Jack. However, if the cats left, they would miss each other, as seen in "Moving Out". The cockroaches have wide heads, vibrantly-colored sclerae with long, pointy black noses and black feet. They also have black "caps" with their antennae, like Oggy.
Dee Dee is the youngest cockroach with a dark blue body, orange head and green eyes. Always hungry, his appetite sometimes reaches insane proportions, often resulting in the consumption of larger animals or other things that would otherwise be inedible (such as hyenas in one case and, due to the effects of a poisonous mushroom in another case, an insect; other instances include the fish on the wallpaper in "Oggy's Clone"/"Oggy's Costume" and a clownfish in "Scuba Diving"). He is known to like opera in "Night at the Opera", wanting to publicly perform on-stage. Sometimes it is shown that his feet are so foul-smelling that the juice they produce is toxic and can melt objects, as seen in "Caught in a Trap"/"High Security Fridge". He is named after bassist Dee Dee Ramone.
Marky is the tallest cockroach with a silver body, green head and pink eyes (originally red). Although Marky originally used to love causing mischief just like Dee Dee and Joey, he has grown to be more laid-back as the series progressed and has a generic role. In most episodes, he is shown with Dee Dee as his partner-in-crime. He sometimes is a hopeless romantic (as seen in "Jealousy" and "Baby Doll"), and his hobbies consist of dating puppets and reading books (which are never shown). He also has bad breath as revealed in "It's a Small World"/"Itsy-Bitsy Oggy". While his eye color changed, they turn red again at one point in "Teleportation". He is named after drummer Marky Ramone.
Joey is the smallest cockroach with a purple-pink body, pink right eye (originally red), a yellow left eye, and a lavender head. Even though he is the shortest roach in the group, he is the most intelligent, always being the brain for their plans – but is sometimes forced to go alone, because Marky and Dee Dee often think that his ideas are stupid. He also loves money (which is shown in several episodes), but his efforts always fall short, usually ending with him getting swatted or beaten up. He is named after lead singer Joey Ramone.
Recurring
Jack is a cat with an olive green body, yellow eyes, red nose, pale pink stomach, and white feet. In contrast to Oggy, he is more short-tempered, violent, and arrogant than him. He can be seen as greedy, as shown in a few episodes where he goes against Oggy or teams up with him (such as Tour De France) for money. He often finds himself building huge machinery, such as roach-catching contraptions, and is very interested in physics and chemistry (that is, the more explosive parts of it), though this has been phased out in later seasons. Jack has an excellent relationship with Oggy, as he cares about him a lot, especially in the episode "Happy Birthday" where he tries to stop Oggy from committing suicide. Jack mostly visits and sleeps at Oggy's house, and owns a green jeep; in which he and Oggy go for a variety of journeys and in mundane cases, for trips to the beach or going fishing. He is sometimes seen trying to propose to Monica, but the cockroaches' pranks always stop it. In one episode ("Don't Rock the Cradle"/"Oggy the Babysitter"), Jack and Monica seem to have a baby together and ask Oggy to babysit their child. In "Just Married", Jack plans to marry a poodle, but it got cancelled at the end due to the cockroaches sneaking in and causing trouble.
Bob is a fierce brown bulldog and Oggy's neighbor, who has severe anger issues with him – especially when Oggy, Jack or the roaches do something that accidentally crushes Bob, shaves his fur or destroys his house, with him proceeding to pummel Oggy or Jack off-screen. Despite this, he has some sort of friendship with them, as notably seen in some episodes like "Olivia", "Steamed Out", "Oggy Splits Hairs", "Back To The Past", etc. Even though Bob is tough, he also has a comically sensitive side, as shown in "Oggy's Teddy Bear", where it's also revealed he's a toy collector. In addition, Bob also works as a police officer in several episodes. However, in one episode ("Back To School"), he was presented as a teacher to Oggy and Jack.
Olivia is a white cat with a yellow bow on her head who debuts in the fourth season's first episode, and becomes Oggy's girlfriend. She is happy-go-lucky and polite, being fond of nature and finding any sort of opportunity for fun. In spite of her optimistic outlooks, though she is aware of the cockroaches' mischief; so she stops them when they are around by using some aggressive methods (however, in "Oggy and the Not-So-Smart Bracelet", she outright retaliates at Marky). Olivia also cares a lot about her appearance, as seen in the episode "Olivia's Pimple", where she refuses to leave her house when she saw a pimple on her face. In "Oggy Is Getting Married!", as the episode title implies, Olivia and Oggy marry after a trip to Venice, Italy and she currently is Oggy's wife. However, their life after said marriage is not shown later in the series.
Other
Oggy's grandma is the least known member of Oggy's family who appears in several episodes, including "Granny's Day" and "Oggy's Grandma" (where she appears to be very strict with Oggy's mannerisms). She also makes a cameo in "Deep Trouble" where she supports Oggy and Jack, along with Monica. In "Granny's Day", she decides to attack the cockroaches, but eventually spared the cockroaches at the end. She is then actually attacked by them in "Oggy's Grandma", once getting her head flattened by the lid of Oggy's toilet. She also gets frequent, short-lasting bursts of energy from coffee, which aids her in defeating the cockroaches. In "Granny's Day", she successfully captures Joey and Marky – but later feels sympathy for them when Dee Dee cries on a picture of the trio, with the other two crossed out.
Monica is Oggy's twin sister and Jack's love interest, the latter of whom she has a child within "Don't Rock the Cradle"/"Oggy the Babysitter". A sporty tomboy compared to Oggy, she's known for being active and taking on physical challenges such as sky diving and bungee jumping. She sometimes is seen rollerskating, and wears a pair of them casually. Out of all the characters, Monica appears the least – however, she makes a brief cameo in "Oggy Is Getting Married!", where she sits next to Bob. She later plays a major role as Olivia's rival in the episode, "Sharing Oggy", although they later become friends.
Lady K is a light yellow female cockroach who debuted in the episode of the same name (also in the fourth season), as the cockroaches' new love interest (mainly Joey's) – to which she takes advantage of. She lives in Olivia's house which Olivia is not aware of, and hates her for unknown reasons. She frequently attempts to use the cockroaches as her pawns to get what she wants or her job done.
Pit is a gray dog living in the same neighborhood as Oggy, who debuted in the fourth season. Like Bob, he is also strong.
Bobette is Bob's daughter who debuted in the fifth season. She is Jack's love interest, as seen in the episodes "Marky's Tournament" (where Marky also had a crush on her) and "Jackromeo and Bobette". She is seen in the episode "Emperor for a Day" as Napoleon's love interest.
The Policeman is an unnamed human policeman who is normally seen in traffic, or sometimes wherever Oggy has traveled to. Sometimes Oggy or Jack accidentally annoy him, due to the cockroaches' mischief. He appears in every season, except for the fifth.
The Doctor is an unnamed human doctor who sometimes visits Oggy's house when Oggy gets sick, or in other cases, when another character (like Jack) assumes Oggy has gone mad. He sometimes wears a nurse's outfit. In the episodes "A Dog Day's Afternoon"/"Cute Little Puppy", it is revealed that he has a pet puppy (which Oggy took care of). He is also shown in "Missing In Action"/"Where is the Exit?" as an artist (specifically, a painter). The Doctor is later absent in season 5.
Production
The project dates back to 1997, shortly after the success of Space Goofs, when Marc du Pontavice asked Jean-Yves Raimbaud to create an animated series in order to "counter the surge of superheroes, mangas and Franco-Belgian comic book heroes. After his death, Olivier Jean-Marie, director of the series, decided not to modify the design of Oggy, in particular his blue color. The first name of each of the three cockroaches, Joey, Dee-Dee and Marky, refers to three of the members of the punk rock group called the Ramones. Oggy, for his part, owes his first name to the famous singer Iggy Pop as well as the character of Ziggy Stardust created by David Bowie. Iggy Pop also sang for the theme song of Space Goofs.

After a four-year gap in production, season 5 was released in late 2017 with two more seasons coming later.[9][10] Season 6 episodes began airing on K2[11] while Season 5 was previewed on Gulli.[12]

Broadcast
Oggy and the Cockroaches originated from France, and the series originally aired on France 3 (seasons 1 and 2 with reruns of seasons 3 and 4), Canal+ Family (seasons 3 and 4), Gulli (seasons 5 to 7, who also reran older episodes from November 2005 to May 2009 on the GRRR!!!, GulliGulli, GulliGang and GulliGood blocks), with reruns airing on other French networks like Canal J, Canal+, Télétoon+, France 4, and Tiji.

In the Philippines, the series aired on TV5 in 2010. In late 2011, it was welcomed on Cartoon Network line-up and adored by the channel, and still airs due to the said show being one of the network's top-viewed programs. It also aired on Disney Channel from 2009 to 31 December 2013. It moved on GMA Network on 3 September 2022, under the network's Astig Authority Saturday morning block.

In Arab countries, it aired on Ajyal TV,[13] MBC3,[14] and Basma Channel. It also airs on 2M in Morocco and local Tunisian channels. (i.e. Tunis 7)

In Italy, it was broadcast on Italia 1, Hiro, Boing, K2, and Frisbee.

It also aired in India from 2009 to 2012 on Nickelodeon. In 2012, the series was taken by Cartoon Network which broadcast the show until its fourth season. In 2015, Nickelodeon started rebroadcasting the show's older episodes, from seasons 1 to 3.[15] Later, the series was also picked up by Sonic Nickelodeon which broadcast the same seasons as Nick. Season 5 started airing on Cartoon Network from 14 August 2017.[16] Seasons 3 and 6, 7 aired later, during 2018–19 in Cartoon Network India. In 2020, Sonic Nickelodeon started airing season 4 again. Cartoon Network aired seasons 5 to 7 until March 2022. From 2021, Sony YAY! took over the rights of all seven seasons.[17]

In the United States, Nickelodeon began airing the series on January 31, 2015. The series' run on the network was short lived, as the series entered a brief controversy when the network aired an episode in which a framed picture of a topless woman was seen in the background of a shot. The episode was quickly removed from rotation, and both the network and Xilam declined to comment. Beginning in April, the series moved to Nicktoons and was quietly removed from the schedule by the end of that year.[18][19]

Controversy
In 2015, a young viewer had pointed out a brief image of a poster in the background with a woman's exposed breasts, which was broadcast on Nickelodeon in the United States on the same day, with some parents complaining about the incident to the network.[34]

Oggy and the Cockroaches' slapstick would also get criticized as being too violent for younger audiences, though the violence has lessened in the new adaptations.

Emily Ashby of Common Sense Media gave the show 2/5 stars, saying that the show "lays up slapstick comedy and physical violence among its mutually contentious characters to get laughs".

PUBG: Battlegrounds (previously known as PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds) is a 2017 battle royale video game published by Krafton, and developed by Krafton's PUBG Studios. The game, which was inspired by the Japanese film Battle Royale (2000), is based on previous mods created by Brendan "PlayerUnknown" Greene for other games, and expanded into a standalone game under Greene's creative direction. Played from either a third-person or first-person perspective, up to one hundred players parachute onto an island where they are tasked to scavenge for weapons and equipment to kill other players while avoiding getting killed themselves. The available safe area of the game's map decreases in size over time, directing surviving players into an ever-tightening space to force encounters.

PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds was first released for Windows via Steam's early access beta program in March 2017, with a full release in December 2017; the same month, Microsoft Studios studios released it for the Xbox One via the Xbox Game Preview program, with a full release coming in September 2018. Afterwards the game was ported to the PlayStation 4, Xbox Series X/S and PlayStation 5 consoles, and the Stadia streaming platform, and has also spawned a mobile version, PUBG Mobile, for Android and iOS. The game is continuously developed under the games as a service model and has been free-to-play for all platforms since January 2022.

The game received positive reviews from critics, who found that while the game had some technical flaws, it presented new types of gameplay that could be easily approached by players of any skill level and was highly replayable. The game was credited with popularizing the battle royale genre, with a number of unofficial Chinese clones also being produced following its success. The game received several Game of the Year nominations and set seven Guinness World Records, among many other accolades. PUBG Corporation has run several small tournaments and introduced in-game tools to help with broadcasting the game to spectators, as they wish for it to become a popular esport. It has sold over 75 million copies on personal computers and game consoles, is the best-selling game on PC and on Xbox One, and is the fifth best-selling video game of all time. Until Q3 2022, the game has accumulated $13 billion in worldwide revenue, including from the more successful mobile version of the game, and it is considered to be one of the highest-grossing video games of all time.

Gameplay
PUBG is a player versus player shooter game in which up to one hundred players fight in a battle royale, a type of large-scale last man standing deathmatch where players fight to remain the last alive. Players can choose to enter the match solo, duo, or with a small team of up to four people. The last person or team alive wins the match.[1]

Each match starts with players parachuting from a plane onto one of the eight maps which have different sizes and terrain.[2] The plane's flight path across the map varies with each round, requiring players to quickly determine the best time to eject and parachute to the ground.[1] Players start with no gear beyond customized clothing selections which do not affect gameplay. Once they land, players can search buildings, ghost towns and other sites to find weapons, vehicles, armor, and other equipment. These items are procedurally distributed throughout the map at the start of a match, with certain high-risk zones typically having better equipment.[1] Killed players can be looted to acquire their gear as well.[1] Players can opt to play either from the first-person or third-person perspective, each having their own advantages and disadvantages in combat and situational awareness; though server-specific settings can be used to force all players into one perspective to eliminate some advantages.[3]

Every few minutes, the playable area of the map begins to shrink down towards a random location, with any player caught outside the safe area taking damage incrementally, and eventually being eliminated if the safe zone is not entered in time; in game, the players see the boundary as a shimmering blue wall that contracts over time.[4] This results in a more confined map, in turn increasing the chances of encounters.[1] During the course of the match, random regions of the map are highlighted in red and bombed, posing a threat to players who remain in that area.[5] In both cases, players are warned a few minutes before these events, giving them time to relocate to safety.[6] A plane will fly over various parts of the playable map occasionally at random, or wherever a player uses a flare gun, and drop a loot package, containing items which are typically unobtainable during normal gameplay. These packages emit highly visible red smoke, drawing interested players near it and creating further confrontations.[1][7] On average, a full round takes no more than 30 minutes.[6]

At the completion of each round, players gain in-game currency based on their performance. The currency is used to purchase crates which contain cosmetic items for character or weapon customization.[8] A rotating "event mode" was added to the game in March 2018. These events change up the normal game rules, such as establishing larger teams or squads, or altering the distribution of weapons and armor across the game map.[9]

Development

Game creator Brendan "PlayerUnknown" Greene in 2018
The game's concept and design was led by Brendan Greene, better known by his online handle PlayerUnknown, who had previously created the ARMA 2 mod DayZ: Battle Royale, an offshoot of popular mod DayZ, and inspired by the 2000 Japanese film Battle Royale.[10][11] At the time he created DayZ: Battle Royale, around 2013, Irish-born Greene had been living in Brazil for a few years as a photographer, graphic designer, and web designer, and played video games such as Delta Force: Black Hawk Down and America's Army.[12][13] The DayZ mod caught his interest, both as a realistic military simulation and its open-ended gameplay, and he started playing around with a custom server, learning programming as he went along.[12] Greene found most multiplayer first-person shooters too repetitive, considering maps small and easy to memorize. He wanted to create something with more random aspects so that players would not know what to expect, creating a high degree of replayability; this was done by creating vastly larger maps that could not be easily memorized, and using random item placement across it.[14] Greene was also inspired by an online competition for DayZ called Survivor GameZ, which featured a number of Twitch and YouTube streamers fighting until only a few were left; as he was not a streamer himself, Greene wanted to create a similar game mode that anyone could play.[14] His initial efforts on this mod were more inspired by The Hunger Games novels, where players would try to vie for stockpiles of weapons at a central location, but he moved away from this partially to give players a better chance at survival by spreading weapons around, and also to avoid copyright issues with the novels.[11] In taking inspiration from the Battle Royale film, Greene had wanted to use square safe areas, but his inexperience in coding led him to use circular safe areas instead, which persisted to Battlegrounds.[11]

When DayZ became its own standalone title, interest in his ARMA 2 version of the Battle Royale mod trailed off, and Greene transitioned development of the mod to ARMA 3.[12] Sony Online Entertainment (now the Daybreak Game Company) had become interested in Greene's work, and brought him on as a consultant to develop on H1Z1, licensing the battle royale idea from him.[12] In February 2016, Sony Online split H1Z1 into two separate games, the survival mode H1Z1: Just Survive, and the battle royale-like H1Z1: King of the Kill, around the same time that Greene's consultation period was over.[15]

Separately, the Seoul-based studio Ginno Games, led by Chang-han Kim and who developed massively multiplayer online games (MMOs) for personal computers, was acquired and renamed Bluehole Ginno Games by Bluehole in January 2015, a major South Korean publisher of MMOs and mobile games.[16][17] Kim recognized that producing a successful game in South Korea generally meant it would be published globally, and wanted to use his team to create a successful title for personal computers that followed the same model as other mobile games published by Bluehole. He had already been excited about making a type of battle royale game after he had played DayZ, in part that the format had not caught on in Korea. He also wanted to make this through an early access model and have a very limited development schedule to get the game out as quickly as possible, while treating the product as a "games as a service" model to be able to support it for many years.[16] In researching what had been done, he came across Greene's mods and reached out to him.[16] In July 2017, Bluehole partnered with social media platform Facebook to provide exclusive streaming content to Facebook's gaming channels, as part of their push to provide more gaming content for its users.[18]

Around the same time that Greene left Sony Online, Kim contacted and offered him the opportunity to work on a new battle royale concept. Within a week, Greene flew out to Bluehole's headquarters in Korea to discuss the options, and a few weeks later, he became the creative director of Bluehole. He moved to South Korea to oversee development.[14] According to Greene, this was the first time a Korean game studio had brought aboard a foreigner for a creative director role, and while it was a risk, he says that his relationship with Bluehole's management is strong, allowing Greene's team to work autonomously with minimal oversight.[6] The game's main musical theme was composed by Tom Salta, who was personally selected by Greene as he and the team were looking for an "orchestral electronic hybrid theme" that would give players a "huge build-up", keeping them "resolutely determined" until a match starts.[19] The music for 6th anniversary was composed by Antti Martikainen.[20]

Development began in early 2016 and was publicly announced that June, with plans to have the game ready within a year.[21][22] Kim served as executive producer for the game.[14] Bluehole started with a team of about 35 developers supporting Greene's work, but had expanded to 70 by June 2017.[23] Greene stated that many of these developers were voluntarily putting in longer work hours into the game due to their dedication to the project, and not by any mandate from himself or Bluehole's management.[14][24] In addition to Bluehole, Greene also credits Bohemia Interactive, the developers of ARMA and DayZ, for support with motion capture animations via their Prague studio.[24][23]

With the rapid growth of interest in the game, Bluehole spun out the entire development for PUBG into Bluehole Ginno Games in September 2017, which was renamed PUBG Corporation with Kim as its chief executive officer. PUBG Corporation continued the development of the game and its marketing and growth, opening an office in the United States with plans for future ones in Europe and Japan.[25] In August 2018, PUBG Corporation launched the "Fix PUBG" campaign, acknowledging that the game by then still had several lingering bugs and other performance issues.[26] The campaign finished in November, with PUBG Corporation calling it a success as everything listed had been implemented by then.[27]

In March 2019, Greene announced that he was stepping down as the game's lead designer, but would still serve as a creative consultant. Tae-seok Jang, the game's art director, would replace him, with Green relocating to PUBG's studio in Amsterdam, PUBG Special Projects.[28] Greene stated that he believed the main PUBG team was at a place to continue developing the game in the direction he had set to keep the game unique among the other battle royale games it had launched, and he wanted to try something not tied to battle royale but still multiplayer-based. The move also put him closer to his family in Ireland.[29]

With the success of PUBG, Bluehole created Krafton as a holding company for its video game assets and studios in 2018, taking over the publishing duties for PUBG and related games.[30][31] By December 2020, Krafton merged PUBG Corporation into their internal studio system, rebranding the team as PUBG Studios.[32]

Design
PUBG represents the standalone version of what Greene believes is the "final version" of the battle royale concept, incorporating the elements he had designed in previous iterations.[6][33] Faster development was possible with the game engine Unreal Engine 4, compared with ARMA and H1Z1, which were built with proprietary game engines. Greene acknowledged that implementing the size of the maps in PUBG has been one of the challenges with working with Unreal, which was not designed with such maps in mind.[6][12] The game was designed as a mix between the realistic simulation of ARMA 3 and the arcade-like action focus and player accessibility of H1Z1.[5] To prevent in-game cheating, the game uses BattlEye anti-cheating software, which had permanently banned over 13 million players by October 2018.[34][35] BattlEye indicated that 99% of all cheating software for the game was developed in China.[36]

Based on Greene's experience with the genre, an island with many terrain features was picked as the first map, known as "Erangel".[11] The map design scope was to offer players many possible options for strategic and unique gameplay.[4] Some buildings and structures were designed to depict the style of the brutalist architecture of the Soviet Union during the 1950s. The developer team playtested architecture features and random item placement systems, looking at both how close-quarters encounters went and open terrain areas.[4] The goal was to optimize the right distribution and placement of weapons and gear across the map, to encourage players to make strategic decisions about how to proceed in the game without overly penalizing players who may not find weapons within the first few minutes of a round.[6] During early access, additional maps were planned, such as one set on a fictional island in the Adriatic Sea that included snow-covered Yugoslavian territories.[37][23] Greene stated that he thought the Erangel map felt disjointed despite meeting their goals for gameplay, and sought to create more unified ideas with future maps.[11]

The freefall from an airplane at the start of each match was a new feature for the genre, encouraging strategy between staying with the pack of players or seeking out one's own route for a better chance at finding good loot.[6] With the added parachute drop, Greene considered that PUBG had three distinct subgames: the airdrop during which one must quickly figure out the best time to jump and where to land in relationship to the other players, the loot game of knowing where and how to gather the best possible equipment, and the combat game with other players.[38] Winners of a match are greeted with the phrase "winner winner chicken dinner", an idiom that Greene had used in his prior battle royale games and kept in PUBG, which itself had origins as early as the Great Depression era.[39]

Greene also introduced microtransactions that allow players to use real-world funds to purchase loot crates that provide randomly-selected cosmetic items, also known as "skins", which they can trade with other players; while Greene recognizes the issue with skin gambling, he believes that Valve has put safeguards in place to support a "skin economy" that will provide further revenue for them without concerns over gambling.[8] However, by November 2017, gray market skin gambling sites began to appear that used PUBG cosmetics as virtual currency.[40] Following controversy over the use of loot boxes to offer "pay-to-win" items in other games in November 2017, the PUBG Corporation affirmed that while they would continue to add new cosmetic items rewarded by in-game crate purchases, they would never add anything that affects or alters gameplay.[41] In May 2018, PUBG Corporation disabled the ability to trade skins on the Steam Marketplace as they found that players were still abusing the system by selling them for monetary value through unofficial third-party platforms.[42] While still in early access, Bluehole offered an early preview of the system by offering time-limited crates that could be purchased during the first PUBG Invitations tournament during Gamescom in August 2017, with the sales from these contributing to the prize pool. Among loot from these crates were special outfits inspired by the original Battle Royale film.[43] Greene anticipates adding a campaign mode with co-operative player support, though there would be "no serious lore" crafted for the narrative, comparing this to similar modes in Watch Dogs.[44]

The game also features custom gamemodes and modding support.[6][14] He considered modding support an essential part of the full release as, just as he had his start with mods, he wants to enable others to create variations on his game so that he could "find the next PlayerUnknown".[45] This was aided by a quiet release of custom server support to a number of influential streamers which subsequently made it into public release.[24] In one case, "Zombie Mode", all but four players pretend to be zombies, who may sometimes distinguish themselves by removing all clothing and are limited only to collecting melee weapons and consumable items, and must rush to attack the other four players, who are able to collect all gear and attempt to outrun and defeat the zombies.[46] Inspired by this mode, Greene announced plans to introduce an official zombie-based gameplay mode based on this into PUBG.[47] Whereas most of the rest of the team continued to develop the core gameplay and maps, Greene is taking on the zombie mode as a near solo project, only using the assistance of the lead animator to help with the zombie animations.[23] Greene sees PUBG as a platform, and would like to see more custom game types and mods developed by players for it.[12] Greene identified that some mods that he also previously worked on from ARMA 3 may become part of the Battlegrounds platform.[12] Greene also wants to incorporate streaming services like Twitch into the game that would enable features supporting Battlegrounds' development as an esport, calling this an "ultimate end goal" for his development, but he wanted to let it progress naturally with players.[6][14][13]

Bluehole used closed alpha and beta periods with about 80,000 players to gauge initial reaction to the gameplay and adjust balance prior to a wider release.[14][48] Just prior to the early access phase on Steam, Bluehole opened a few servers and invited some popular live streamers of similar games to try it out as to start gaining interest.[49] Early access for the Windows version launched on March 23, 2017.[50] This period was planned to last approximately six months, originally aiming for a September 2017 release.[50][51] In July 2017, Greene announced that they would need to extend the early access period by a few months, continuing to release updates on a regular basis, with plans to still release by the end of 2017, as committing to this original period "could hinder us from delivering a fully featured game and/or lead to disappointment within the community if the launch deadline is not met".[52] Initially, Bluehole had expected that they would just gain enough players through early access to smooth out the gameplay, and only when the game was completed, they would have started more marketing for the title. The sudden interest in the game from early access exceeded their expectations, and put emphasis on the stability of the game and its underlying networking alongside gameplay improvements.[48] Through August 2017, these updates generally included a major weekly patch alongside major monthly updates that provided key performance improvements.[53] However, from August onward, Bluehole backed off the rate of such patches, as the high frequency has led to some quality control issues, and the developers rather make sure each patch content is well-vetted by the community before providing new updates; this did not change their plans for a 2017 release, where it fully released out of early access on December 20.[54][55]

In part of the game's success in early access, Tencent Games, the largest publisher of video games in China, approached Bluehole that same month with an offer to publish PUBG in China.[56] However, the China Audio-Video and Digital Publishing Association issued a statement in October 2017 that discouraged battle royale-style games, stating that they are too violent and deviate from Chinese values of socialism, deeming it harmful to young consumers.[57][58] The following month however, PUBG had reached a formal agreement with the Chinese government to allow the release of the game in the country, with Tencent as the publishing partner.[59] However, some changes were made to make sure it aligned with socialist values and traditional Chinese morals.[60] In South Korea, the game is marketed and distributed by Kakao Games.[61]

Despite the lack of a Chinese publisher prior to the Tencent deal, players in China had found ways to acquire and play the game through Steam via proxies and other networking tricks.[62] To address it, PUBG Corporation planned to add maximum client ping limits for servers which can reduce the issues with latency problems and prevent some of the cheating that has occurred. This would not prevent cross-region matchmaking but may make it difficult for some players to play outside their region if they have a poor Internet infrastructure.[63] Tencent has also helped by identifying and reporting around 30 software programs to Chinese police that can be used to cheat in PUBG, leading to over a hundred arrests by the beginning of 2018.[64] Separately, this technical issue, in addition to the larger number of Chinese players, has created complaints in the player community. Some Western players fear that many Chinese players are able to cheat in the game by exploiting some of the network latency issues, something that PUBG Corporation continued to address as the game shifted out of early access. However, a small number of players called for server segregation by region and had used racial insults at Chinese players they encountered in game. Greene was disappointed with this "xenophobic attitude", calling it "disgraceful", and asked the player community to respect the Chinese players more as their numbers were a key part of the game's success.[62] Greene also identified that players can easily get around such region locks using virtual private networks, making this approach ineffective.[65] PUBG Corporation eventually added region-based matchmaking by October 2018, though players still reported issues with connectivity and slow matchmaking.[66]

PUBG Lite was a free version of PUBG that was meant to be better playable on low-end computers by having significant reductions in graphic details and other features, but is otherwise feature complete with the full game. The version was meant to be played in regions where the game's minimum specifications may be difficult for average players to achieve, with a beta launch first releasing in Thailand in January 2019, and in Europe that October.[67][68] PUBG Lite was shut down on April 29, 2021.[69][70]

On January 12, 2022, the game became free to play. A new account tier, called Battleground Plus, was made available for purchase that includes additional customization items and in-game experience boosts. Owners of the game who purchased prior to January 12 were automatically upgraded to Battleground Plus for free.[71] Battleground Plus allows for playing in ranked mode and on custom servers and includes additional customization items and in-game experience boosts.[72][73]

Consoles
Greene was part of Microsoft's press conference during E3 2017 to announce that PUBG would be coming to Xbox One as a timed console exclusive sometime by the end of 2017, using the Xbox Game Preview early access approach to test it.[74][75][48]

Initially, Greene said that Microsoft was not directly involved in the porting but only providing assistance to make sure the port is good, and that most of the porting responsibilities are being done by Anticto, a Spanish developer.[45] However, at Gamescom that year, Bluehole affirmed that Microsoft Studios would be publishing the Xbox One version of the title, helping to make a planned 2017 release for this version.[76] Greene said that Microsoft's support has helped in several ways, not only for the Xbox One version but improving the performance and security of the Windows version. Further, by being part of the group of studios under the Microsoft banner, they have been able to talk and incorporate technology from other developers, such as improved water rendering techniques they obtained from Rare that they had developed for Sea of Thieves.[77] Microsoft considered PUBG to be an important project to demonstrate their company's ability to be more than just a publisher, according to Microsoft's Nico Bihary who lead the project. Bihary said they have given PUBG a "white glove" treatment, and for the Xbox One port, they have provided services from their advanced technology group and time and support from The Coalition, another of Microsoft Studios' subsidiaries.[78] Kim also stated that the team was interested in cross-platform play between the Windows and console versions, but did not anticipate this as a release feature, as they need to determine how to mitigate the advantage keyboard and mouse-using players would have over those using controllers.[48]

Titled "Game Preview Edition", the early access version for the Xbox One was released on December 12, 2017, in both digital and physical formats.[79] To promote it, Microsoft performed real-life supply crate drops in Australia in the week prior, with the crates containing Xbox hardware, Battlegrounds merchandise, and other goods, using passcodes published alongside the drop locations on social media.[80] The Xbox version also includes Xbox-specific in-game cosmetic items, some of which could be purchased directly rather than through in-game crates.[81] The official release out of the Game Preview program occurred on September 4, 2018.[82][83] Xbox Series X/S version and PlayStation 5 version releases were announced via a post on the office website. The game launched on November 10, 2020, in Xbox Series X/S. PUBG Corporation confirmed the Xbox Series X version will feature a consistent 60 FPS gameplay while the Xbox Series S version features a 30 FPS gameplay, however they've also claimed the framerate cap will be raised in the near future. The game also features account transition and cross-platform play.[84]

With the announcement of the Xbox release, PUBG Corporation stated that there were plans to port to additional platforms, such as the PlayStation 4.[85][86][87] In an interview shortly after Gamescom, Greene said that their deal with Microsoft did not exclude a PlayStation 4 port, but that their focus at the time was only on the Windows and Xbox One version, given the small size of their team.[77][56] When asked about it in January 2018, Kim stated that the team released the game first on the Steam and Xbox Game Preview early access programs as they both easily allowed in-development games to be released and updated over time, which contrasted with Sony's lack of their own early access program, as well as their strict quality control for even completed games.[88] The PlayStation port was officially announced in November, and was released on December 7, 2018. PUBG Corporation studio head Brian Corrigan said that while they had a small team working on the PlayStation 4 port for some time, it was only until the Xbox One port was mostly completed that they began fully working on the PlayStation port.[89] The PlayStation 4 version of the game includes platform-exclusive customization items, specifically the outfit of Nathan Drake from the Uncharted series, and Ellie's backpack from The Last of Us.[90] A short live-action film to promote the PlayStation 4 release was directed by Jordan Vogt-Roberts and starred Jason Mitchell.[91] The PlayStation 5 version of the game was released along with the PlayStation 5 console on November 12, 2020. The publisher claimed those who purchased the game on PlayStation 4 will be able to freely upgrade and download the game, and players could experience a consistent 60 FPS gameplay, account transition and support for cross-platform play.[92]

Cross-platform play support between the Xbox and PlayStation versions of PUBG was added in October 2019 following a testing period during the prior month.[93][94]

PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds – Pioneer Edition was released on the streaming service Stadia on April 28, 2020. The game was free for Stadia's paid subscribers on launch.[95]

Mobile versions

Following the Chinese publication deal for the Windows version, Tencent Games and PUBG Corporation additionally announced that they were planning on releasing two mobile versions based on the game in the country.[96][97] The first, PUBG: Exhilarating Battlefield, is an abridged version of the original game, and was developed by LightSpeed & Quantum Studio, an internal division of Tencent Games.[98] The second, PUBG: Army Attack, includes more arcade-style elements, including action taking place on warships, and was developed by Tencent's TiMi Studio.[99] Both versions are free-to-play, and were released for Android and iOS devices on February 9, 2018.[100][101] The games had a combined total of 75 million pre-registrations, and ranked first and second on the Chinese iOS download charts at launch.[101] Following a soft launch in Canada, an English version of Exhilarating Battlefield, localized simply as PUBG Mobile, was released worldwide on March 19, 2018.[102][103][104] Following its release, a Korean and Japanese oriented version of the game released in June 2018, under the title name PUBG Mobile KR. A Vietnamese version, PUBG Mobile VN released in January 2019.

In China, PUBG Mobile had been awaiting approval by the government for an authorized release, during which the game could only be offered as a public test. However, Tencent's planned release was suspended due to the government approval freeze across most of 2018. By May 2019, Tencent announced it would no longer seek to publish PUBG Mobile in China, but instead would re-release the game under the title Game for Peace that readily meets China's content restrictions, such as eliminating blood and gore.[105] Taiwanese version of the game was released following the Chinese version, as PUBG Mobile TW. A version meant for lower-end mobile devices which features a smaller map made for 60 players, PUBG Mobile Lite, was released on July 25, 2019.[106][107] This had support for high FPS gameplay on multiple Android devices.[108] The Chinese version of the app was again renamed to Peacekeeper Elite in 2020.[109]

Support for 90 FPS gameplay was added for selected OnePlus devices in August 2020.[108][110]

On May 6, 2021, Krafton announced the relaunch of the game in India, following the ban imposed by the Government of India. Krafton directly published the game instead of Tencent as a newly named title which could only be accessed by users in India as Battlegrounds Mobile India.[111][112]

Esports

PUBG: Battlegrounds esports studio at the 2019 G-loot Grandslam
To celebrate the game surpassing two million copies sold, Bluehole announced a 2017 Charity Invitational event, inviting 128 players to compete over their official Twitch channel to raise money for the Gamers Outreach Foundation, with Bluehole matching all donations up to US$100,000.[113] The competition ran in early May 2017, and raised at least US$120,000 from viewers along with Bluehole's US$100,000 match, and served as a prototype for future esports events for the game.[114] During the August 2017 Gamescom event, Bluehole and ESL organized the first PUBG invitational tournament, with a $350,000 prize pool. Separate events were held for solo players, two-player teams, two-player teams fixed to first-person perspective, and four-player squads. Each event featured three matches, with the player or team scoring the highest across all three named winners.[43][115][116]

Greene said that while he had envisioned the battle royale format to be a spectator sport since his ARMA II mod, their approach to making PUBG an esport would be a matter of taking "baby steps". Greene said that they would not actively pursue esports until after the game was fully released and that all major bugs were eliminated. The Gamescom 2017 event demonstrated the issues surrounding the logistics of running a large PUBG tournament with a large number of players involved, and they had worked alongside ESL to explore how to do this effectively in the future. Further, Greene stated there was also the need to establish a format for presenting a PUBG match to make it interesting to spectators, which he thought would take some time to develop given the nature of the emergent gameplay, comparing it to established first-person shooters and multiplayer online battle arena esport games.[117] A 20-team, 80-player tournament with a US$200,000 prize pool was organized by Intel in Oakland in November 2017.[118][119]

Other games and media
Krafton had looked to expand PUBG beyond the core game as to expand the narrative universe. As part of this, PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds was quietly rebranded as PUBG: Battlegrounds around July 2021.[120]

Starting in 2020, Krafton released a series of live-action documentaries starring Jonathan Frakes that explored the origins of the game's Battlegrounds. Ahead of the game's Taego expansion in July 2021, Krafton released another live-action short called "Ground Zero", featuring Ma Dong-seok (aka Don Lee).[121]

Krafton announced a partnership with Adi Shankar in July 2021 to develop an animated series based on the PUBG universe.[122]

In 2019, Krafton created a new studio Striking Distance, helmed by Glen Schofield, who previously led development on the Dead Space series. In 2020, Schofield revealed that the studio was working on The Callisto Protocol, a game set in the PUBG universe but in the far future, taking place on a prison colony established on Jupiter's moon Callisto.[123]

Krafton announced a new game in development named PUBG: New State. This particular game is separated from PUBG: Battlegrounds but taking place in the PUBG Universe. Pre-registrations were opened for the game on February 25, 2021.[124] It was released on 11 November that year for iOS and Android.[125] The game takes place in the year 2051 and is based on future warfare.[126] On January 27, 2022, the title name changed from "PUBG: New State" to "New State Mobile".[127]

Battlegrounds received "generally favorable reviews" on all platforms, with the exception of the PlayStation 4 version which received "mixed or average reviews", according to review aggregator website Metacritic.[128] During both its early access phase and after, the game also surpassed numerous player-count records. Bluehole released statistics for the first four months of release that showed that over ten million rounds of Battlegrounds had been played, effectively equal to more than 25,000 man-years of time.[138] Data by SteamSpy showed that Battlegrounds had surpassed long-standing popular titles in concurrent player count on Steam, such as Fallout 4 and Grand Theft Auto V, eventually overtaking Dota 2, the most played game on the platform for years, in August 2017.[139][140] The following month, the game had its peak concurrent player count reach over 1.3 million, surpassing Dota 2's all-time record of 1.29 set in March 2016.[141][142][143] The game then reached a concurrent player count of two million in October 2017,[144] and three million by the end of the year.[145] The game has also been shown popular in South Korean PC bangs; analysis firm Gametrics reported that Battlegrounds had surpassed Overwatch and became the second-most played game in the country by August 2017, only behind League of Legends,[146] it subsequently surpassed League of Legends by October 2017.[147] Battlegrounds' popularity in China led to a large increase in users of Steam from there, with more than half of Steam clients having Chinese as their default language in late 2017.[62]

Several journalists commented on the game's rapid growth towards a large player base for a game that was still in early access. Greene had confidence that the game could reach over a million players within a month, but some of his development team were only anticipating around 200,000 to 300,000 within the first year, and were surprised by its performance in its first month.[148] Greene himself believed that the strong growth was buoyed by non-traditional promotional channels like Twitch streamers and other content creators, which they have since worked to introduce new gameplay elements ahead of public release.[77] IGN's Rad believed that the popularity of the game was due to its fast-paced nature compared to similar type games available at the time, such as H1Z1 and DayZ. She thought that the design balanced the solitary periods when the player is scavenging or sneaking around with those of being in combat with others, and the approach is readily accessible to new players with very little waiting time to get into a new match.[149] Andy Moore for Glixel considered that Battlegrounds' popularity comes from how the game encouraged players to engage due to the situation they are placed in rather than from the player's own disposition, comparing it to the Stanford prison experiment, and thus the game is able to capture the interest of players who may normally eschew these types of games.[150]

Rock Paper Shotgun's Michael Johnson described Battlegrounds as "a tactical shooting sandbox, a story generator, and a horror game all in one", providing some of the "highest highs" in multiplayer gaming as reason for its popularity.[151] Rob Zacny for Waypoint found that Battlegrounds offered the same type of entertainment experience for viewers that many other player-vs-player survival games have, but because of the lack of persistence, players were more likely to experiment with resources rather than hoard them, leading to humorous or unexpected situations that are often absent in survival games and making the title more enjoyable to watch and play, leading to its popularity.[152] Jeff Grubb of Venture Beat considered Battlegrounds a paradigm shift in the first-person shooter market similar to how Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare also changed the landscape of shooters when it was released in 2007, and believed it did this by being an anti-Call of Duty in terms of pacing and strategy.[153] IGN's Chloi Rad has praised the game's gunplay, saying the game "has taken the military-sim gameplay... [and] boiled it down to its most exciting parts."

Sales
Battlegrounds made US$11 million in the first three days of its Windows early access release in March 2017.[154] By the second week of April, the game had sold over one million copies, with a peak player count of 89,000,[155] SuperData Research estimated that the game's April sales exceeded US$34 million, putting it as one of the top 10 highest grossing revenue games for the month and exceeding revenue from Overwatch and Counter-Strike: Global Offensive.[156] By May 2017, the game had sold over two million copies, with total gross revenues estimated at US$60 million.[157][158] Within three months of its early access release, it had surpassed over five million copies sold,[159] and Bluehole announced it had exceeded US$100 million in sale revenue.[160] Battlegrounds reached this four million mark faster than Minecraft, which took over a year to reach similar sales figures while it was in its paid-beta development period.[161]

By September 2017, Bluehole's value, as tracked by a firm that tracks private Korean corporations, increased five-fold from June of that year to US$4.6 billion, primarily due to Battlegrounds.[56] By December 2017, PUBG Corporation reported that there were more than 30 million players worldwide between the Windows and Xbox versions.[162] The research firm SuperData estimated that Battlegrounds drew in more than US$712 million in revenue within 2017.[163] By February 2018, the game had sold over thirty million on Steam according to Steam Spy.[164] The following month, Steam's President Gabe Newell stated that the game was the third highest-grossing game of all time on the platform.[165] PUBG: Battlegrounds is the best-selling video game on PC and on Xbox One. Before the release of the PlayStation 4 version, 42 million copies were sold on PC and 9 million copies on Xbox One.[166][167]

Within three days of going live on the Xbox Live Preview Program in mid-December 2017, Microsoft announced that Battlegrounds had sold more than a million copies on the platform. Alongside this, Microsoft announced that Battlegrounds would be offered as a free add-on for those buying the Xbox One X console through the end of 2017.[168] A month after release, the Xbox version had sold more than four million copies and was the fourth bestselling game in the United States, according to The NPD Group.[169][170] By March 2018, the game had sold forty million copies across all platforms, which had risen to over fifty million by June, averaging over 87 million players daily with over 400 million players in total.[171][172] The mobile version had over 100 million downloads by August 2018,[173] and exceeded 225 million by October 2018,[174] a figure higher than the combined player base for Fortnite at nearly the same point in time. In 2018, the bulk of these players were in Asian countries such as China and India, where PUBG Mobile was released before Fortnite and could run on lower-powered mobile hardware.[175][176] China was the game's largest player base.[174] PUBG was the most popular online game in India in 2018 (but it was banned by the government of India in 2020; see below).[177]

PUBG was the top-selling PC paid game of 2017,[178] having sold 30 million copies worldwide and grossed about $900 million.[179] By June 2018, it had sold more than 50 million copies worldwide.[172] PUBG was again the top-selling PC paid game of 2018, increasing its annual sales revenue to $1.028 billion.[180] In addition, the free-to-play PUBG Mobile became the first mobile battle royale game to gross over $1 billion,[181] reaching over $1.5 billion as of 2019.[182]

PUBG Mobile was the second most-downloaded mobile game of 2018, with nearly 300 million downloads worldwide. The game's largest market was China, which accounted for 29% of the game's downloads, followed by India and the United States each with about 10% (30 million) of its downloads. It was the most-installed battle royale game of 2018, with about 200 million more installs than Fortnite, which received 82 million installs on mobile devices.[183] In 2019, PUBG Mobile reached 555 million downloads worldwide, with India accounting for 116 million (21%) of the downloads, China 108 million (19%), and the United States 42 million (8%).[182]

In Japan, PUBG was the most popular PC game during 2017.[184] PUBG Mobile grossed ¥3.58 billion ($32.42 million) in Japan during 2018.[185] In January 2019, the PlayStation 4 version of Battlegrounds sold 7,447 copies within its first week in Japan, which placed it at number 14 on the all-format sales chart.[186] By December 2019, the PC and console versions of the game had sold over 60 million copies, in addition to PUBG Mobile having exceeded 600 million downloads.[187] By July 2020, computer and console software sales had exceeded 70 million units sold,[188] in addition to PUBG Mobile accumulating 734 million downloads.[189] PUBG Mobile had grossed over $3.5 billion in revenue by August 2020.[190] PUBG Mobile grossed over $2.6 billion in 2020, making it the highest-grossing game of the year and bringing its total revenue to over $4.3 billion by December 2020.[191]

In March 2021, it was reported that PUBG Mobile had accumulated 1 billion downloads outside of China since launch.[192] By December 2022, PUBG Mobile has grossed $9 billion worldwide,[193] while Battlegrounds Mobile India surpassed 100 million downloads from the Google Play store.[194] By the end of 2021, PUBG: Battlegrounds had an average of 70 million daily users.[195] After selling more than 75 million copies, the original PC and console game converted to free-to-play,[196] and according to Krafton's revenue report for the first quarter of 2022, the free-to-play transition was the reason for the increase in the game's profits. PC sales had increased by 61 percent for a revenue of $82.3 million. In gaming consoles, sales revenue increased by 274 percent over the last year, and monthly active users also increased by almost 300 percent. The PC and console versions of the game have a total revenue of $4 billion since the game's release in 2017.[179][197][198][199][180] Combined with the mobile version, which generated $9 billion in revenue until Q3 2022,[193] PUBG: Battlegrounds has a total revenue of $13 billion.

Awards
While still in early access, Battlegrounds won the "Best Multiplayer Game" and was also nominated for the categories "Game of the Year" and "Best Ongoing Game" at The Game Awards 2017.[201] The game's nomination for "Game of the Year" created some debate, being the first early access title to be named for one of the top industry awards.[202][203] Also, about a month before it was released, the game won "Best Multiplayer Game" and "PC Game of the Year" at the 35th Golden Joystick Awards,[204] whereas its other nominations were for "Studio of the Year" (PUBG Corporation) and "Ultimate Game of the Year".[205] It also won the "Breakout Game of the Year" award at PC Gamer's end of the year awards,[206] whereas its other nomination was for "Game of the Year".[207] Polygon ranked the game second on their list of the 50 best games of 2017,[208] and The Verge named it one of their 15 Best Games of 2017,[209] while Entertainment Weekly ranked it seventh on their "Best Games of 2017" list.[210]

Litigation
Epic Games lawsuit
Battlegrounds is considered as one of the games that have boosted the popularity of the battle royale game genre, even though other games, including Greene's previous mods, were already on the market.[259] After its large early access sales numbers, other games followed with battle royale mechanics, with either existing games that added a battle royale mode or fully new games. Notably, Epic Games updated their in-development title Fortnite, a sandbox-based survival game that included the ability to construct fortifications, to include a battle royale mode that retained the fortification aspects. Known as Fortnite Battle Royale, Epic later released it as a standalone free-to-play game in September 2017. Shortly after its release, Bluehole expressed concerns about the game, acknowledging that while they cannot claim ownership of the battle royale genre, they feared that since they had been working with Epic for technical support of the Unreal engine, they may have had a heads-up on planned features they wanted to bring to Battlegrounds and could release it first.[260] PUBG Corporation later filed a lawsuit against Epic Games Korea in January 2018, alleging that Fortnite Battle Royale was infringing the copyright of Battlegrounds.[261] However, the lawsuit was closed by PUBG in June 2018 for undisclosed reasons.[262]

Greene had expressed concern on the large number of games that have simply cloned the Battlegrounds mechanics, particularly in China where clones of Battlegrounds are considered a new genre of "chicken-eating game" (based on the "winner winner chicken dinner" line to a match winner in Battlegrounds).[263][264] Greene said "I want this genre of games to grow. For that to happen you need new and interesting spins on the game mode. If it's just copycats down the line, then the genre doesn't grow and people get bored."[259] Greene claimed no ownership of the battle royale or last man standing genres, but believed that the clones were taking some specific mechanics he had developed in Battlegrounds and prior mods, such as the initial parachuting segment or the red-zone bombing runs, and would like to see legislation to give developers like himself protection against these types of concepts as well as improve creativity as developers invent new approaches to mimic such innovations.[265] Battlegrounds' explosive growth and how it popularized the battle royale genre was considered one of the top stories in the video game industry during 2017.[266][267][268]

NetEase lawsuit
Prior to release of their mobile versions, PUBG Corporation initiated legal action in the Northern District Court of California against Chinese game publisher NetEase in January 2018, claiming that their mobile games Rules of Survival and Knives Out infringe on Battlegrounds' copyrights. PUBG's lawsuit asserts that Rules of Survival is "a copyrightable audio-visual work, individually and/or in combination with other elements of Battlegrounds", and identified several elements that appear similar in both games. While some of these elements are common features of a battle royale game, PUBG asserted that other elements referencing specific facets of Battlegrounds, such as references to chicken for winning a game or using cookware as weapons or armor, imply a connection to Battlegrounds. PUBG seeks both monetary damages and an injunction to prevent NetEase from further distribution of the games. NetEase, in responding to PUBG's request to Apple to remove the games, denied that their games violated Battlegrounds' copyrights.[269][270] By March 2019, the two companies had reached an undisclosed agreement and were working to get the cases dismissed.[271]

National bans
In March 2019, Battlegrounds was banned in the Indian state of Gujarat after the local government decided the game was too addictive and an unnecessary distraction during exam season.[272] A number of students caught playing the game were arrested as a result.[273][274] The ban was not renewed in some cities in the state after March as exam season had ended.[272] A similar ban was enacted in Nepal and Iraq in April 2019, with the cited reasons being that the game was harmful to children and teenagers.[275][276] The ban in Nepal was shortly lifted by the country's Supreme Court, stating that the government could not enforce such a ban that interfered with personal freedoms without demonstrating why the ban was necessary.[277] In mid-2019, Jordan and the Indonesian province of Aceh issued similar bans.[278][279]

On July 1, 2020, Battlegrounds was banned in Pakistan by Pakistan Telecommunication Authority, citing the reasons that the game is addictive, a wastage of time and poses a serious negative impact on the physical and psychological health of children, after receiving various complaints from different segments of society and Lahore High Court's directions to look in the matter. However, the ban was temporary till further orders from the court.[280] The game continued to remain banned in Pakistan for a month. A meeting was held on July 30, 2020, between PTA and legal representatives of Proxima Beta, who addressed the queries raised by the authority and emphasized on continued engagement and a comprehensive control mechanism. After this, the ban on Battlegrounds was lifted.[281]

Amidst the ongoing 2020 China–India skirmishes, the Indian government banned PUBG Mobile along with more than 100 other Chinese apps, most made by Tencent and NetEase, on September 2, 2020, asserting the apps were "stealing and surreptitiously transmitting user data in an unauthorized manner to servers which have locations outside India".[282][283] India was PUBG Mobile's largest market with the country accounting for 175 million downloads and 24% of global users.[284]

Free Fire is a free-to-play battle royale game developed and published by Garena for Android and iOS.[4] It was released on 8 December 2017. It became the most downloaded mobile game globally in 2019 and has over 1 billion downloads on Google Play Store. In the first quarter of 2021 it was the highest grossing mobile game in the US.[5] In November 2019, it surpassed $1 billion in lifetime revenue.[6] As of 2021, Free Fire had surpassed 150 million daily active users.[7][8] In September 2021, Garena released Free Fire Max, a graphically enhanced version of the game with improved textures, lighting, and sound effects.[9]

Popular Game Modes
The game features two main game modes: Battle Royale and Clash Squad. In Battle Royale, 50 players are dropped onto an island and must fight to be the last one standing. Clash Squad is a team-based mode where two teams of 4 players fight each other in a best-of-5 match. Free Fire features a variety of weapons, items, and vehicles that players can use to survive. The game also has a system of playable characters with unique skills.[10][11]

Tournaments
The Free Fire World Series, the official annual esports competition of the game, became the most watched esports event at the time with over 5.4 million peak live viewers.[12][13]

Gameplay
In Free Fire, players control a character in a third-person perspective. The fire button allows them to shoot and throw items. The character can perform actions such as jumping, crawling, and lying down. During gameplay, players can utilize the "Gloo Wall" grenade as a form of cover to protect against damage.[14]

Game modes
Free Fire offers over 15 game modes, including Team Deathmatch, Clash Squad, Big Head, Explosive Jump, Cold Steel, Zombie Hunt, Rampage, and Pet Mania.[15] However, modes other than Battle Royale, Clash Squad, and Lone Wolf are only available during special events.[16][17]

The Battle Royale mode in Free Fire accommodates up to 52 players landing on an island without weapons. They must fight to be the last one standing by scavenging weapons and equipment from buildings. Playing this mode in ranked mode will affect their ranking. There are 6 maps to choose from: Bermuda, Bermuda Remastered, Kalahari, Purgatory, Alpine, and NeXTerra. The mode allows for solo, duo, or squad play.[18][19]

Clash Squad is a 4-player versus 4-player mode where players purchase weapons and items from an in-game shop during preparation time, then engage in combat against the opposing team. The mode is played in a best-of-7 format, lasting anywhere from 4 to 7 rounds. Each round is won when all players from one team are killed, either by their opponents or through environmental factors. As of 2022, the maps used in Clash Squad are the same as those in Battle Royale mode. The mode can be played as either Ranked or Casual.[20][21]

Lone Wolf is a variation of the Clash Squad mode that can be played as either a 1-player versus 1-player or 2-player versus 2-player "duo" format with more intricate rules. In each round, both sides have the opportunity to select their equipment for the next 2 rounds. The game is played in a best-of-5 format. If both teams have won 4 rounds each, a final round begins with both sides able to choose any weapon they prefer. All players are automatically equipped with basic items such as a vest and helmet from the start of the round. This mode takes place on its own map known as Iron Dome.[22][23]

Free Fire Craftland editor
Free Fire Craftland Editor
Craftland allows players to design their own maps in Free Fire using an in-game builder tool. The maps created can be shared and played with others. Craftland also supports script editing for advanced customization, giving creators greater freedom to bring their ideas to life. Players can add buildings, gameplay elements, and decorations to the map until they reach the maximum space limit. There are two maps available for players to use as the base for their designs.[24][25]

Character system
Free Fire Character System
Free Fire Character System
Free Fire features a character system of 50+ characters. Each character has a unique skill which can be active or passive. Active skills can be triggered manually by an in-game button and passive skills are triggered automatically. Each character can equip 4 skills including the character's skill and 3 skills from other characters (one active skill and three passive skills can be equipped by a single character).[26] Free Fire characters have unique backstories. A few of these characters were inspired by real-life celebrities whom Free Fire had collaborations with, such as Chrono from the collaboration with Cristiano Ronaldo,[27] Dimitri & Thiva from the collaboration with Dimitri Vegas & Like Mike,[28] A-Patroa from the collaboration with Anitta,[29] Alok from the collaboration with DJ Alok[30] and JBeibs from the collaboration with Justin Bieber.[31] In the game, it is possible to acquire all characters by using gold, an in-game currency that can be earned through gameplay and event participation, or with Diamonds which can be bought with real-world currency.[32]

Pet System
In Free Fire, pets can provide support to players during fights. As of 2023, the game features 21 different pets that players can choose to bring into battle. Each pet has a special ability that sets it apart from the others. Some of these abilities are passive and trigger automatically, while others are active and require manual activation. One of the pets in the game, Poring, was added as part of a collaboration with Ragnarok Online. Players can also customize their pets with skins and emotes.[33]

Ranking System
In Free Fire, a seven-tier ranking system, including sub-tiers like Bronze I, II, III, categorizes players by skill and performance. Players earn ranking points based on kills, damage, survival time and standing position, progressing from Bronze to Grandmaster. Seasons reset ranks (e.g., from Silver III to Bronze I or II). There are two ranked modes: Battle Royale rank mode and Clash Squad rank mode.[34][35]

Premise
Free Fire's premise is detailed in animated shorts and other materials published by Garena to promote the game. Free Fire Universe is the universe where the game, comics and stories take place. Each character has a different story and a family background and characters are connected to each other. There are three cities in the universe, called La Luna, Griza, and New Dawn where the characters live. Characters are divided into two factions: the Horizon and the Mambas. The Horizon is the ruling faction of the city where the rich and powerful people are while the Mambas are a liberation group against the Horizon.[36] In 2022 Free Fire released the first short film, "How to Start a Fire", which featured the character Hayato Yagami.[37][38]

Reception
The graphics were described as having "a benefit for mid- and low-specification phones", but a reviewer stated that "if games with good graphics are your thing then we don't recommend that you play Free Fire Battlegrounds. But if you like battle royale games and want to have fun with your friends, you should definitely play."[39]

Tais Carvalho of Techtudo commented that Free Fire "prioritizes performance, making it a great choice for any type of device. The gameplay stands out and has enough content to entertain and offer rewarding combat." Regarding the progression of characters and skills, she said it is "a flashy add-on".[40]

In the Google Play annual list of "Best Apps of the Year", Free Fire won in the "Best Popular Vote Game" category of 2019, being the most publicly voted in Brazil and in Thailand.[41][42]

Garena Free Fire is one of the most popular battle royale mobile games, behind PUBG Mobile, Fortnite Battle Royale and Call of Duty: Mobile. It is particularly popular in Latin America, India and Southeast Asia.[43] Free Fire was the fourth most downloaded game on the Google Play Store in the fourth quarter of 2018,[44] and was the fourth most downloaded game worldwide in 2018 on iOS and the Google Play Store together.[45] The title earned approximately 182 million downloads in 2018, making it the second most downloaded battle royale mobile game (above Fortnite Battle Royale and behind only PUBG Mobile),[46] and grossed approximately $19.3 million in monthly revenues through December 2018, becoming a significant financial success for Garena.[47][48] As of August 2021, Garena Free Fire has more than one billion downloads on the Google Play Store.[49][50]

At the end of Q1 2021, Free Fire surpassed PUBG Mobile in revenues in the United States, generating $100 million in turnover as compared to PUBG Mobile's $68 million.[51] Free Fire's revenues jumped by 4.5 times as compared to the same period in the previous year.[52]

By November 2019, Free Fire had grossed over $1 billion worldwide.[53][54] It went on to become the fourth highest-grossing video game of 2020 with $2.13 billion,[55] and then the eighth highest-grossing mobile game of 2021 with $1.2 billion,[56] for a total of at least $4.33 billion grossed as of 2021.

In 2020 and 2021, Free Fire won the Esports Mobile Game of the Year award at the Esports Awards.[57]

Main article: Free Fire World Series
Free Fire World Series
Free Fire began the Free Fire World Series (FFWS) esports competition in 2019. In 2020, FFWS was replaced by a series of regional events, the "Free Fire Continental Series" (FFCS), due to the COVID-19 pandemic.[58][59] In February 2021, Garena announced the Free Fire World Series (FFWS) with a $2 million prize pool.[60]

In 2021, the Free Fire World Series became the most-watched esports event in history with over 5.4 million peak live viewers, surpassing the 2022 League of Legends World Championship which had 5.1 million peak viewers.[61][62][63]

Regional events
The "EMEA Invitational" was a replacement for the Free Fire World Series in 2021 for Europe, the Middle East and Africa. This championship featured a total of 12 teams. With a prize pool of USD 200,000.[64]

The Free Fire Asia Championship was a replacement for the Free Fire World Series in 2021 for Asia. This championship featured a total of 31 teams from Vietnam, Indonesia, Thailand, India, Taiwan, and MCP (Malaysia, Cambodia, and Pakistan). The teams compete for a prize pool of USD 400,000.[65]

The Liga Brasileira de Free Fire (LBFF) is the main Free Fire esports event in Brazil. Comprising 3 divisions, Series A, B, and C, it is played in two stages a year, with the elite qualifying for the Free Fire World Series.[66]

Free Fire Max
Free Fire Max is an enhanced version of Free Fire that was released in 2021.[67][68] It features improved High-Definition graphics, sound effects, and a 360-degree rotatable lobby. Players can use the same account to play both Free Fire Max and Free Fire, and in-game purchases, costumes, and items are synced between the two games.[69] Both games are connected with FireLink technology,[70][71] which allows players from both games to play together simultaneously. In February 2022, Government of India banned Free Fire along with 56 other apps on security reasons of connection to China, however Free Fire Max remained available on play store and app store in the country.[72]

Collaborations
Collaboration with other popular franchises is a major marketing strategy used to promote the game. Since its launch, Free Fire collaborated with popular video games, celebrities, TV shows and films.[73] Free Fire has two types of collaborations which are global and regional. Unlike global collaborations, regional collaborations are only available to players from specific regions. In 2022, Free Fire collaborated with singer Justin Bieber and debuted his song "Beautiful Love" in Free Fire.[74][75]

Controversies
In January 2022, PUBG developer Krafton filed a lawsuit against Garena and its parent company Sea for copyright infringement. The lawsuit accused Garena of copying in-game items, game mechanics and overall look and feel of PUBG: Battlegrounds and PUBG Mobile in their games Free Fire and Free Fire Max. According to Krafton, "Free Fire and Free Fire Max extensively copy numerous aspects of Battlegrounds, both individually and in combination, including Battlegrounds' copyrighted unique game opening 'air drop' feature, the game structure and play, the combination and selection of weapons, armor, and unique objects, locations, and the overall choice of color schemes, materials, and textures."[97]

On 14 February 2022, the India's Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology banned Free Fire along with 53 other apps which posed a threat to India's privacy and security[98][99] under Section 69A of the Information Technology Act, Constitution of India.

List of iPhone models

The iPhone is a line of smartphones developed and marketed by Apple that run iOS, the company's own mobile operating system. The first-generation iPhone was announced by then–Apple CEO Steve Jobs on January 9, 2007, at Macworld 2007, and launched later that year. Since then, Apple has annually released new iPhone models and iOS versions; the most recent models being the iPhone 16 and 16 Plus, and the higher-end iPhone 16 Pro and 16 Pro Max. As of January 1, 2024, more than 2.3 billion iPhones have been sold, making Apple the largest vendor of mobile phones in 2023.

The original iPhone was the first mobile phone to use multi-touch technology. Throughout its history, the iPhone has gained larger, higher-resolution displays, video-recording functionality, waterproofing, and many accessibility features. Up to the iPhone 8 and 8 Plus, iPhones had a single button on the front panel, with the iPhone 5s and later integrating a Touch ID fingerprint sensor. Since the iPhone X,[note 2] iPhone models have switched to a nearly bezel-less front screen design with Face ID facial recognition in place of Touch ID for authentication, and increased use of gestures in place of the home button for navigation.[note 3]

The iPhone, which operates using Apple's proprietary iOS software, is one of the two major smartphone platforms in the world, alongside Android. The first-generation iPhone was described by Steve Jobs as a "revolution" for the mobile phone industry. The iPhone has been credited with popularizing the slate smartphone form factor, and with creating a large market for smartphone apps, or "app economy", laying the foundation for the boom of the market for mobile devices. In addition to the apps that come pre-installed on iOS, there are nearly 2 million apps available for download from Apple's mobile distribution marketplace, the App Store, as of August 2024.

History
Main article: History of the iPhone
Development of an Apple smartphone began in 2004, when the company started to gather a team of 1,000 employees led by hardware engineer Tony Fadell, software engineer Scott Forstall, and design officer Jony Ive,[1] to work on the highly confidential "Project Purple".[2][3]

Then Apple CEO Steve Jobs steered the original focus away from a tablet (which was later revisited in the form of the iPad) towards a phone.[4] Apple created the device during a secretive collaboration with Cingular Wireless (later renamed AT&T Mobility) at an estimated development cost of US$150 million over thirty months.[5] According to Jobs in 1998, the "i" word in "iMac" (and thereafter "iPod", "iPhone" and "iPad") stands for internet, individual, instruct, inform, and inspire.[6][7]

Apple rejected the "design by committee" approach that had yielded the Motorola ROKR E1, a largely unsuccessful "iTunes phone" made in collaboration with Motorola. Among other deficiencies, the ROKR E1's firmware limited storage to only 100 iTunes songs to avoid competing with Apple's iPod nano.[8][9] Cingular gave Apple the liberty to develop the iPhone's hardware and software in-house, a rare practice at the time,[10][11] and paid Apple a fraction of its monthly service revenue (until the iPhone 3G),[12] in exchange for four years of exclusive U.S. sales, until 2011.[13]

Jobs unveiled the first-generation iPhone to the public on January 9, 2007, at the Macworld 2007 convention at the Moscone Center in San Francisco.[14] The iPhone incorporated a 3.5-inch multi-touch display with few hardware buttons, and ran the iPhone OS operating system with a touch-friendly interface, then marketed as a version of Mac OS X.[15] It was the first mobile phone to use multi-touch technology.[16] The device launched on June 29, 2007, at a starting price of US$499 in the United States, and required a two-year contract with AT&T.[17] The price was reduced by a third after two months. The resulting complaints forced Jobs to issue an apology and offer a partial rebate early purchasers of the Phone.[18]


Worldwide iPhone availability:

On July 11, 2008, at Apple's Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC) 2008, Apple announced the iPhone 3G, and expanded its launch-day availability to twenty-two countries, and it was eventually released in 70 countries and territories.[19][20] The iPhone 3G introduced faster 3G connectivity, and a lower starting price of US$199 (with a two-year AT&T contract).[21] It proved commercially popular, overtaking Motorola RAZR V3 as the best selling cell phone in the U.S. by the end of 2008.[22] Its successor, the iPhone 3GS, was announced on June 8, 2009, at WWDC 2009, and introduced video recording functionality.[23]

The iPhone 4 was announced on June 7, 2010, at WWDC 2010, and introduced a redesigned body incorporating a stainless steel frame and a rear glass panel.[24] At release, the iPhone 4 was marketed as the "world's thinnest smartphone";[24] it uses the Apple A4 processor, being the first iPhone to use an Apple custom-designed chip. It introduced the Retina display, having four-times the display resolution of preceding iPhones, and was the highest-resolution smartphone screen at release;[24] a front-facing camera was also introduced, enabling video calling functionality via FaceTime.

Users of the iPhone 4 reported dropped/disconnected telephone calls when holding their phones in a certain way, and this issue was nicknamed "antennagate".[25] In January 2011, as Apple's exclusivity agreement with AT&T was expiring, Verizon announced that they would be carrying the iPhone 4, with a model compatible with Verizon's CDMA network releasing on February 10.[26][27]

The iPhone 4s was announced on October 4, 2011, and introduced the Siri virtual assistant, a dual-core A5 processor, and an 8 megapixel camera with 1080p video recording functionality. The iPhone 5 was announced on September 12, 2012, and introduced a larger 4-inch screen, up from the 3.5-inch screen of all previous iPhone models, as well as faster 4G LTE connectivity.[28] It also introduced a thinner and lighter body made of aluminum alloy, and the 30-pin dock connector of previous iPhones was replaced with the new, reversible Lightning connector.[28]


Bottom angle comparison between iPhone 5c (top), iPhone 5s (middle), and iPhone 4s (bottom)
The iPhone 5s and iPhone 5c were announced on September 10, 2013. The iPhone 5s included a 64-bit A7 processor, becoming the first ever 64-bit smartphone;[29] it also introduced the Touch ID fingerprint authentication sensor.[30] The iPhone 5c was a lower-cost device that incorporated hardware from the iPhone 5, into a series of colorful plastic frames.[31]

On September 9, 2014, Apple introduced the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus, and included significantly larger screens than the iPhone 5s, at 4.7-inch and 5.5-inch respectively; both models also introduced mobile payment technology via Apple Pay.[32] Optical image stabilization was introduced to the 6 Plus' camera. The Apple Watch was also introduced on the same day, and is a smartwatch that operates in conjunction with a connected iPhone. Some users experienced bending issues from normal use with the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus, particularly on the latter model, and this issue was nicknamed "bendgate".[33]

The iPhone 6s and 6s Plus were introduced on September 9, 2015, and included a more bend-resistant frame made of a stronger aluminum alloy, as well as a higher resolution 12 megapixel main camera capable of 4K video recording.[34] The first-generation iPhone SE was introduced on March 21, 2016, and was a low-cost device that incorporated newer hardware from the iPhone 6s, in the frame of the older iPhone 5s.[35]

The iPhone 7 and 7 Plus were announced on September 7, 2016, which introduced larger camera sensors, IP67-certified water and dust resistance, and a quad-core A10 Fusion processor utilizing big.LITTLE technology;[36] the 3.5 mm headphone jack was removed, and was followed by the introduction of the AirPods wireless earbuds.[37] Optical image stabilization was added to the 7's camera. A second telephoto camera lens was added on the 7 Plus, enabling two-times optical zoom, and "Portrait" photography mode which simulates bokeh in photos.[38]

The iPhone 8, 8 Plus, and iPhone X were announced on September 12, 2017, in Apple's first event held at the Steve Jobs Theater in Apple Park. All models featured rear glass panel designs akin to the iPhone 4, wireless charging, and a hexa-core A11 Bionic chip with "Neural Engine" AI accelerator hardware. The iPhone X additionally introduced a 5.8-inch OLED "Super Retina" display with a "bezel-less" design, with a higher pixel density and contrast ratio than previous iPhones with LCD displays, and introduced a stronger frame made of stainless steel. It also introduced Face ID facial recognition authentication hardware, in a "notch" screen cutout, in place of Touch ID;[39][40] the home button was removed to achieve the “bezel-less” design, replacing it with a gesture-based navigation system.[41] At its US$999 starting price, the iPhone X was the most expensive iPhone at launch.[42]

The iPhone XR, iPhone XS, and XS Max were announced on September 12, 2018. All models featured the "Smart HDR" computational photography system, and a significantly more powerful "Neural Engine".[43] The XS Max introduced a larger 6.5-inch screen. The iPhone XR included a 6.1-inch LCD "Liquid Retina" display, with a "bezel-less" design similar to the iPhone X, but does not include a second telephoto lens; it was made available in a series of vibrant colors, akin to the iPhone 5c, and was a lower-cost device compared to the iPhone X and XS.[44]

The iPhone 11, 11 Pro, and 11 Pro Max were announced on September 10, 2019. The iPhone 11 was the successor to the iPhone XR, while the iPhone 11 Pro and 11 Pro Max succeeded the iPhone XS and XS Max. All models gained an Ultra-Wide lens, enabling two-times optical zoom out, as well as larger batteries for longer battery life.[45][46] The second-generation iPhone SE was introduced on April 17, 2020, and was a low-cost device that incorporated newer hardware from the iPhone 11, in the frame of the older iPhone 8, while retaining the home button and the Touch ID sensor.[47]

The iPhone 12, 12 Mini, 12 Pro, and 12 Pro Max were announced via a livestream event on October 13, 2020. All models featured OLED "Super Retina XDR" displays, introduced faster 5G connectivity, and the MagSafe magnetic charging and accessory system; a slimmer flat-edged design was also introduced, which combined with stronger glass-ceramic front glass, added better drop protection compared to previous iPhones.[48][49] The iPhone 12 Mini introduced a smaller 5.4-inch screen, while the 12 Pro and 12 Pro Max had larger screens of 6.1-inch and 6.7-inch respectively. The iPhone 12 Pro and 12 Pro Max additionally added a Lidar sensor for better accuracy in augumented reality (AR) applications.

The iPhone 13, 13 Mini, 13 Pro, and 13 Pro Max were announced via a livestream event on September 14, 2021. All models featured larger camera sensors, larger batteries for longer battery life, and a narrower "notch" screen cutout.[50] The iPhone 13 Pro and 13 Pro Max additionally introduced smoother adaptive 120 Hz refresh rate "ProMotion" technology in its OLED display, and three-times optical zoom in the telephoto lens.[51] The low-cost third-generation iPhone SE was introduced on March 8, 2022, and incorporated the A15 Bionic chip from the iPhone 13, but otherwise retained similar hardware to the second-generation iPhone SE.

The iPhone 14, 14 Plus, 14 Pro, and 14 Pro Max were announced on September 7, 2022. All models introduced satellite phone emergency calling functionality. A new 14 Plus model introduced the large 6.7-inch screen size, first seen on the iPhone 12 Pro Max, into a lower-cost device.[52] The iPhone 14 Pro and 14 Pro Max additionally introduced a higher-resolution 48-megapixel main camera, the first increase in megapixel count since the iPhone 6s; it also introduced always-on display technology to the lock screen, and an interactive status bar interface integrated in a redesigned screen cutout, entitled "Dynamic Island".[53]

The iPhone 15, 15 Plus, 15 Pro, and 15 Pro Max were announced on September 12, 2023. Starting with this group of devices, all models switch to using USB-C as their power connector to comply with European Commission regulations, replacing Apple's proprietary Lightning connector after eleven years of use in previous models.[54] The 15 and 15 plus now feature the Dynamic Island, which debuted with the iPhone 14 Pro (effectively retiring the "notch" display cutout), a 48-megapixel main camera, slightly curved edges, and a color-infused frosted glass back.[55][56][57] The 15 Pro and Pro Max also replace the mute switch with the "Action" button, and stainless-steel material to titanium.[57]

The iPhone 16, 16 Plus, 16 Pro, and 16 Pro Max were announced on September 9, 2024. The former two introduced a vertical camera layout with refined "Fusion" and Ultra-Wide cameras.[58] The 16 Pro and Pro Max have larger 6.3-inch and 6.9-inch displays, a 48-megapixel Ultra-Wide camera, and the largest batteries in an iPhone up to that point.[59] All models now include access to new Apple Intellegence AI features,[60] a refined thermal system, support for Wi-Fi 7, and a new button dubbed the "Camera Control", allowing easier access to camera features.

Production
Up to the iPhone 4, all iPhones and other devices, such as iPod Touch models and iPads, were manufactured by Foxconn, based in Taiwan. In 2011, new CEO Tim Cook changed Apple's manufacturing strategy to diversify its supply base. The iPhone 4s in 2012 was the first model to be manufactured simultaneously by two stand-alone companies: Foxconn and Pegatron, the latter also based in Taiwan. Although Foxconn still produces more iPhones, Pegatron's orders have been slowly increased: the company made part of the iPhone 5c line in 2013, and 30% of iPhone 6 devices in 2014. The 6 Plus model was produced solely by Foxconn.[62] In 2019, Apple investigated reports that some Foxconn managers had used rejected parts to build iPhones.[63] In India, Apple pays Wistron, a Taiwan-based manufacturer with a plant near Bangalore, to assemble iPhones to sell in the region.[64]

In 2022, Apple announced that a portion of the iPhone 14 would be manufactured in Tamil Nadu, India, as a response to China's "zero-COVID" policy that has negatively affected global supply chains for many industries.[65] Apple has stated that they plan to shift 25% of iPhone production to India by 2025.[66]

Hardware
Main article: iPhone hardware
Apple directly sub-contracts hardware production to external OEM companies, maintaining a high degree of control over the end product. The iPhone contains most of the hardware parts of a typical modern smartphone. Some hardware elements, such as 3D Touch and the Taptic Engine, are unique to the iPhone. The main hardware of the iPhone is the touchscreen, with current models offering screens of 4.7 inches and larger. All iPhones include a rear-facing camera; the front-facing camera dates back to the iPhone 4. The iPhone 7 Plus introduced multiple lenses to the rear-facing camera. A range of sensors are also included on the device, such as a proximity sensor, ambient light sensor, accelerometer, gyroscopic sensor, magnetometer, facial recognition sensor or fingerprint sensor (depending on the model) and barometer. In 2022, Apple added satellite communications to the iPhone, with the release of the iPhone 14 and iPhone 14 Pro.[67]

Software
Operating system
Main articles: iOS and iOS version history
The iPhone runs iOS.[68] It is based on macOS's Darwin and many of its userland APIs, with Cocoa replaced by Cocoa Touch, and AppKit replaced by UIKit. The graphics stack runs on Metal, Apple's low-level graphics API. The iPhone comes with a set of bundled applications developed by Apple,[69] and supports downloading third-party applications through the App Store.[70]

Apple provides free updates to iOS over-the-air, or through Finder and iTunes on a computer.[71] Major iOS releases have historically accompanied new iPhone models.[72][73] The most recent version is iOS 18.[74]

App Store and third-party apps
See also: iOS SDK and App Store
At WWDC 2007 on June 11, 2007, Apple announced that the iPhone would support third-party Ajax web applications that share the look and feel of the iPhone interface.[75] On October 17, 2007, Steve Jobs, in an open letter posted to Apple's "Hot News" weblog, announced that a software development kit (SDK) would be made available to third-party developers in February 2008.[76] The iPhone SDK was officially announced and released on March 6, 2008.[77] The App Store was launched with the release of iPhone OS 2.0, on July 11, 2008.[78]

Apple requires all third-party apps to be downloaded from the App Store, with exceptions for ad-hoc apps used within enterprises. Developers must pay a yearly $99 fee as part of Apple's Developer Program;[79] if their membership expires, their apps are removed from the App Store, though existing users retain the ability to redownload the app.[80] Developers can release free apps, or paid apps for which Apple takes a 30% cut of proceeds.[81] Developers earning less than $1 million in annual sales qualify for the App Store Small Business Program, with Apple only taking a 15% fee.[82]

Though iOS has far lower market share than Android, its app ecosystem has been described as superior, with higher-quality apps, and more iOS-exclusive releases.[83] Android's version fragmentation,[84] less uniform hardware, and lower app revenues have been cited as key factors.

All apps must pass Apple's app review process before being distributed in the App Store.[85] Apple may also stop distributing apps it deems inappropriate. For example, in 2009, Apple rejected the Newspapers app due to The Sun's "obscene" topless Page 3 girls.[86] In 2018, Apple removed Tumblr from the App Store, citing illegal content, causing Tumblr to ban all adult content from their platform.[87] The App Store's review process has been criticized by developers as "frustrating", "anti-competitive", and "asinine".[88][89][90][91]

Users can also install native apps outside of the App Store through jailbreaking,[92] or through exploits, such as TrollStore. Jailbreaking may cause security issues, and is not supported by Apple.[93]

As of October 2013, Apple has passed 60 billion app downloads.[94] As of September 2016, there have been over 140 billion app downloads from the App Store.[95] In January 2017, the App Store had over 2.2 million apps for the iPhone.[96][97] As of August 2024, Apple's App Store contains nearly 2 million applications.[98]

Jailbreaking
Main article: iOS jailbreaking
Apple restricts the installation of unapproved third-party apps and does not allow full access to the iPhone's filesystem. According to Jonathan Zittrain, the emergence of closed devices like the iPhone has made computing more proprietary than it was in the PC era.[99] Jailbreaking allows users to install apps not available on the App Store, customize their device in ways not allowed by Apple, and bypass SIM locks without carrier approval.[100] Some jailbreak tweaks were later copied by Apple and implemented into iOS, like multitasking, widgets, and copy and paste.[101]

Apple attempted to use the DMCA to fight jailbreaking; however in 2010, the U.S. found jailbreaking to be legal.[102] Jailbroken iPhones are at higher risk of malware due to Apple's lesser control of the app ecosystem.[103] In the United States, Apple cannot void an iPhone's warranty solely due to jailbreaking.[104] Jailbreaks rely on exploits. Apple has improved the iPhone's hardware and software security, making these exploits harder to find; as a result, recent iPhones cannot currently be jailbroken.[105]

Accessibility
The iPhone contains a range of accessibility features to support users' visual, auditory, and motor needs. iPhones can notify users through onscreen banners, audio alerts, vibrations, or the LED flash; vibration patterns can be customized by users. Since iOS 15, Siri can read notifications out loud through earphones, and, since iOS 16, through the device's speakers.[106]

Users with motor needs can use Assistive Touch to customize the way they navigate through menus; it can assist users who have difficulties with some gestures, like pinching, and makes these gestures available by tapping on a menu. The user can create their own gestures and customize the layout of the AssistiveTouch menu. If the user has trouble pressing the Home button, it can be set so that it can be activated with an onscreen tap. Gestures, like rotate and shake, are available even when if the iOS device is mounted on a wheelchair. Head Tracking can be used to control an iPhone using facial movements recognized by the front camera.[107]

Low-vision users can enable VoiceOver, a screen reader which describes what is on the screen, while Siri allows for hands-free interaction. The iPhone also supports wireless braille displays to help users read its interface. Text can be enlarged system-wide. The Magnifier app uses the iPhone's Lidar scanner to identify objects, for example doors, people, and objects, and can describe them to the user, as well as their distance. Door Detection can alert the user through sound, speech, and haptics.[107]

Hearing aids that are part of the Made for iPhone program can be controlled from an iPhone. These hearing aids also feature Live Listen, which enables the iPhone to act as a directional microphone, beaming its audio to compatible hearing aids.[108] Live Listen can help the user hear a conversation in a noisy room or hear someone speaking across the room.[109] Apple built Live Listen support into all AirPods, which can also relay audio from a connected iPhone's microphone. Closed captioning and external TTY devices are supported, while Live Caption can transcribe audio across all apps and display it onscreen. Sound Recognition can recognize surrounding noises, including door bells, kettles, water running, and babies crying, and notify the user with an onscreen alert.[107]

Guided Access helps people with autism, ADHD, or sensory challenges stay focused on a single app. With Guided Access, a parent, teacher, or therapist can limit an iOS device to stay on one app by disabling the Home button and limit the amount of time spent in an app. The user can restrict access to the keyboard or touch input on certain areas of the screen.

Marketing
The original iPhone was heavily promoted before its official announcement, creating buzz and anticipation.[110] Upon its release, it was marketed heavily in television, web and print ads created in partnership with TBWA\Chiat\Day.[111]

Apple's premium market positioning has led the iPhone to be seen as a status symbol.[112][113][114]

The Apple ecosystem has been described as a key moat that increases iPhone brand loyalty. iMessage has especially been singled out with its "green bubbles" phenomena. In iMessage, SMS messages from Android users appear as green bubble, rather than the blue bubbles used for texts from other iPhone users. Group chats between iOS and Android are poorly supported; reactions display as text, rather than bubbles, and images are sent through MMS, which degrades image quality. Some teens have described being "ostracized" after switching to Android,[115] which Google has labeled "bullying".[116] This has been described by critics as a key factor leading 87% of U.S. teenagers to use iPhones.[117]

Retail
SIM unlocking
Many iPhones bought through a monthly carrier contract are SIM locked, restricting their use to one particular carrier.[118] While the iPhone was initially sold in the U.S. only on the AT&T network with a SIM lock in place, various hackers found methods to bypass that SIM lock.[119] More than a quarter of first-generation iPhones sold in the U.S. were not registered with AT&T. Apple speculated that they were likely shipped overseas and unlocked, a lucrative market before the iPhone 3G's worldwide release.[120][121] Today, many carriers either remove the SIM lock automatically after a certain period, or do it upon request, either for free or for a small fee.[122] iPhones bought from Apple are not SIM locked.[118] Many carriers also sell the iPhone unlocked when purchased outright rather than on a long-term contract.

Retail strategy
Since 2013, iPhone buyers can obtain a trade in discount when buying a new iPhone directly from Apple. The program aims to increase the number of customers who purchase iPhones at Apple Stores rather than carrier stores.[123] In 2015, Apple unveiled the iPhone Upgrade Program, a 24-month leasing agreement, which Fortune described as a "change [in] iPhone owners' relationships with mobile carriers".[124]

Repairability

iPhone 6s's interior; the left half contains the display and the right half contains hardware and battery
Only Apple Stores and Apple Authorized Service Providers are allowed by Apple to perform genuine replacements.[125] Apple has taken steps to make third-party repairs more difficult. iPhone components are soldered, and many are glued together.[126] iPhones receive low repairability scores, in part due to the difficulty of obtaining genuine parts, and the difficulty undertaking each repair.[127] This has given rise to the right to repair movement, aimed at giving users cheaper options for repairing their phones. Apple has lobbied against right to repair legistation.[128] Multiple jurisdictions aim to introduce right to repair laws, including the EU,[129] UK,[130] and U.S.[131]

In the past, Apple bricked iPhone 6 models after their home buttons were replaced, displaying an Error 53 message; Apple called this a bug, and released an update to address the issue.[132] On iPhones with a Touch ID sensor, the home button cannot be replaced by users or independent repair shops without losing Touch ID functionality, since Apple has not made their calibration tool public.[133]

Starting with the iPhone XR, Apple displays warnings in the Settings app if the battery, display, or camera are replaced by a third party.[134] Additionally, some features are disabled when a part labeled "non-genuine" is detected, like True Tone, or the battery health measurement. iFixit notes that a proprietary, cloud-linked System Configuration tool is required to "complete" a part repair, meaning that even replacing a genuine part with another genuine part will fail Apple's "genuine parts" check unless said tool is used.[135]

In 2022, Apple rolled out a self-service repair program, allowing any user to buy parts, rent repair tools from Apple, and obtain repair manuals. The program received a degree of praise by iFixit and repair advocates, who also critically noted that Apple maintains control over the parts supply.[136][137]

Privacy
Tracking prevention
Apple introduced App Tracking Transparency (ATT) with iOS 14.5 in April 2021. ATT requires apps to ask for explicit permission before being allowed to track the user across other apps and websites. If the user refuses, the app cannot access Apple's Identifier for Advertisers (IDFA), an identifier used to serve personalized ads. [138] ATT does not prevent personalized ads that are based on the user's behavior within the app itself.[139] The feature has been criticized by some as anti-competitive, including Facebook, whose shares fell by 26% after its rollout.[140] Apple exempts their own apps from their anti-tracking measures, which has led to anti-trust investigations by the French and German governments.[141][142]

Location tracking controversy
In July 2010, Apple claimed that it collected iPhone users' GPS coordinates and nearby Wi-Fi networks twice a day; a Wall Street Journal investigation found that Google’s Android sent this data "several times an hour".[143][144]

In September 2010, forensic expert Christopher Vance discovered a hidden unencrypted file named "consolidated.db" that contained a record of iPhone users' locations.[145][146] The file was added with the June 2010 iOS 4 update, though previous versions of iOS stored similar information in a file called "h-cells.plist".[147] On April 20, 2011, The Guardian publicized research by Alasdair Allan and Pete Warden, who found that anyone with physical access to an iPhone could obtain a detailed record of its owner's location and movements over the past year.[148] Moreover, the file was automatically backed up by iTunes onto any computer the iPhone was synchronized with.[149] A Wall Street Journal investigation found that users' locations were still stored when location services are disabled.[150] The controversy led to U.S. congressional scrutiny and an FCC investigation,[146] and was dubbed "Locationgate" by the media.[151]

Apple responded on April 27, 2011, claiming that the data was used to cache nearby Wi-Fi hotspots and cell towers in order to improve location speed and accuracy. The company also claimed that locations being collected when location services were off, and being stored for more than a year, were both bugs.[151] Apple issued an update for iOS (version 4.3.3, or 4.2.8 for the CDMA iPhone 4) which reduced the size of the cache, encrypted it, stopped it being backed up to iTunes, and erased it entirely whenever location services were turned off.[152] Nevertheless, in July 2014, a report on state-owned China Central Television called iPhone tracking a "national security concern".[153]

Currently, iPhones contain a "Frequent Locations" database which records where users have been, along with exact times they arrived and left, raising concerns that the data could be used in court.[154] This feature can be turned off.[155]

Child safety controversy
In August 2021, Apple announced plans to scan iCloud Photos for child abuse imagery (through an algorithm called "NeuralHash"), and filter explicit images sent and received by children using iPhones (dubbed "Conversation Safety"), to be rolled out later that year.[156] More than 90 policy and human rights groups wrote an open letter to condemn both features.[157] Apple's plan to implement NeuralHash on-device rather than in the cloud led the EFF and security experts to call it a "backdoor" that could later be expanded to detect other types of contents, and would decrease users' privacy.[158] Apple claimed the system was "misunderstood",[159] but announced in December 2022 that the photo-scanning feature would never be implemented.[160] The other feature, Conversation Safety, was added in iOS 15.2.[161]

Security
Apple's iOS operating system is regarded by some security experts as more secure against common malware than Android.[162] Less than 1% of mobile malware targets iOS.[163]

Prior to 2014, the iPhone stored all "messages, pictures and videos, contacts, audio recordings [...] and call history" in unencrypted form, enabling easy access by law enforcement.[164] This changed with iOS 8, which adopted file-based encryption. Apple does not hold the decryption key, and cannot be compelled to turn over user data, even when presented with a government warrant.[165] Companies like Grayshift and Cellebrite developed exploits that enable law enforcement to extract user data from iPhones without needing the user's passcode.[166][167]

In 2015 and 2016, a dispute unfolded between Apple and the FBI. The FBI had recovered the iPhone 5c of one of the San Bernardino attackers, and iCloud backups of that phone from a month and a half before the shooting. The U.S. government attempted to obtain a court order under the All Writs Act compelling Apple to produce a modified version of iOS that would allow investigators to brute force the device passcode.[168][169] Tim Cook responded on the company's website, outlining a need for encryption, arguing that a backdoor would compromise the privacy of all iPhone users.[170] The DOJ withdrew its request after the FBI bought an exploit to bypass the iPhone's passcode.[171] As a countermeasure, Apple implemented USB Restricted Mode,[172] which was subsequently exploited too.[167]

In 2016,researchers discovered the Pegasus suite of exploits targeting iOS and Android, which led to significant international media coverage.[173] Some Pegasus exploits are zero-click, meaning that they can fully compromise the device with no user interaction, for example by sending a malformed iMessage to the user that would not even trigger a notification.[174] Pegasus can collect most data, including chats, passwords, and photos, and can turn on the phone's microphone and camera remotely.[175][176] Apple quickly issued an update fixing FORCEDENTRY and other known Pegasus exploits,[177] though Pegasus continued to be used, relying on new exploits.[178] Apple announced a new bug bounty for vulnerabilities, and added an optional Lockdown Mode to iOS 16 that reduces the iPhone's attack surface.[179][180] Many security researchers have criticized Apple's bug bounty for underpaying researchers, being uncommunicative, and being slow to fix vulnerabilities, and two Apple employees told The Washington Post that the company "has a massive backlog of bugs that it hasn’t fixed".[181]

Prominent victims of Pegasus include Jamal Khashoggi, and numerous activists, businessmen and politicians.[182] Pegasus has been widely used since 2011,[183] and is still used by law enforcement and governments as of July 2022.[184]

Reception and legacy
The original iPhone has been described as "revolutionary",[185] a "breakthrough handheld computer",[186] and "the best phone that anybody has ever made".[187] It is now Apple's bestselling product, and has been credited with helping to make Apple one of the world's most valuable publicly traded companies by 2011.[188] Newer iterations have also received praise and awards.[189][190]

Before the iPhone, smartphones were mostly used for texting, calls, and email; more advanced functions were harder to use and inconvenient on a small screen.[191] They were also hard to develop for, and lacked a thriving app ecosystem like the App Store (released in 2008).[192][193] Many phones were heavily customized by mobile carriers, which led to feature fragmentation and prevented these phones from turning into thriving software platforms.[194] In contrast, Apple's iPhone SDK provided a wide range of APIs, made mobile development far more accessible,[195][196] and was instrumental in turning the iPhone into a "Swiss army knife" with a wide range of features and apps.[191]

Successive iPhone models have generated significant fan enthusiasm, with many customers queuing up in front of Apple Stores on launch day.[197] As of 2021, the iPhone has higher brand loyalty than any other smartphone.[198]

The iPhone's success has led to the decline of incumbents Nokia, BlackBerry, and Motorola.[199][200] RIM, Symbian and Microsoft all attempted to develop more modern operating systems to compete with the iPhone, like Maemo, Windows Phone, and BlackBerry 10; all were unsuccessful. Google successfully started over on their Android project,[191] and designed it for mass adoption by carriers and phone hardware manufacturers.[201] Today, iOS and Android account for 99% of smartphones used worldwide.[202]

Sales

Steve Jobs's initial target was to reach 1% of phone market share in 2008.[203] Apple sold 6.1 million units of the original iPhone between Q3 FY2007[note 4] and Q4 FY2008, and 11.3 million units of the iPhone 3G in Q4 FY2008 and Q1 FY2009.[204] In 2008, the iPhone reached 1.1% of worldwide mobile phone market share,[205] and 8.2% of the smartphone market.[206] During this time it was quickly becoming relevant in North America, and in market share was ranked second in the U.S. in 2009, behind the BlackBerry;[207] in 2010 the iPhone 3GS was the best-selling smartphone in the U.S., the first time that an iPhone device reached top spot in that market.[208]

iPhone sales grew continuously year-over-year since its introduction until Q2 FY2016.[209][210] The iPhone briefly surpassed BlackBerry in Q4 FY2008,[211] and permanently overtook it starting in Q3 FY2010.[212] By 2011, Apple sold 100 million iPhones worldwide,[213] and became the largest mobile phone vendor in the world by revenue, surpassing long-time leader Nokia.[214] Q1 FY2012 marked Apple's best quarterly earnings in its history, with 53% of the company's revenues coming from iPhone sales.[215] Phone sales are strongly seasonal, peaking in the holiday season (Apple's Q1). With the release of the iPhone 13 in Q1 FY2022, Apple temporarily topped Samsung, with 84.9 million units shipped compared to Samsung's 68.9 million. In most quarters, Apple is the second largest smartphone vendor by units.[212][note 5] Apple sold 223 million iPhones in its financial year 2023 ending September 24.[216][217]

Today, Samsung and Apple dominate the smartphone market, with 21.8% and 15.6% worldwide market share respectively.[218] Due to Apple's small lineup, Apple often dominates the list of bestselling smartphone models.[219][220] Despite its lower market share, the iPhone's premium positioning has led it to capture nearly half of global smartphone revenue,[221] and 80% of global smartphone profits, with Samsung taking the other 20%.[222] Carriers compete with each other to subsidize iPhone upgrades, which is seen as a significant factor in iPhone sales, though this has reduced carrier profits.[223] On July 27, 2016, Apple announced that it had sold their 1 billionth iPhone.[224] As of January 1, 2024, more than 2.3 billion iPhones have been sold.[225]

Compared to other high-tech products, a greater proportion of iPhone users are female.[226] The iPhone has been adopted by both consumers and business users.[227] iPhone users are wealthier and spend more time on their phones than Android users on average.[228][229] The iPhone is especially popular in the U.S., where it has a 50% market share,[230] and is used by 87% of teenagers.[117] Worldwide, the iPhone accounts for 78% of the high-end ($1,000+) smartphone market.[230]

Android overtook the iPhone's installed base in 2010, according to NPD Group.[231] During Apple's earnings call on January 27, 2021, Tim Cook said that 1 billion iPhones were being actively used worldwide.[232]

Emerging markets
While other manufacturers make separate entry-level phones, Apple's entry-level phones are the previous years' models, part of an effort to increase its market share in emerging markets without diluting its premium brand.[233][234] It also considers emerging market tastes in its product designs; for example, it introduced a gold iPhone after finding that gold was seen as a popular sign of a luxury product among Chinese customers.[235] In 2017, Apple started manufacturing previous years' iPhone models in India; in 2022, it began manufacturing the current iPhone 14 there too.[236] Analysts have speculated that this was partly caused by Apple's desire to reduce its dependence on China, and to overcome Indian import duties.[236][237] In 2023, the Chinese government banned the use of iPhones by government civil servants in what was seen as an effort to reduce dependence on foreign technology and strengthen cybersecurity.[238]

In May 2024 Iranian president Mokhber banned imported iPhone 14 and newer models, in November the ban was lifted and replaced with 30% customs tariff to the phones.[239][240]

 The naming of the iPhone X (Roman numeral "X" pronounced "ten") marked the 10th anniversary of the iPhone, thus skipping the iPhone 9.
 Touch ID and the home button are still used for the budget iPhone SE series.
 Each company may choose different quarters for their fiscal year. Apple's fiscal quarters correspond to the following months: Q1 ends in late December, Q2 ends in late March, Q3 ends in late June, and Q4 ends in late September. All references to quarters in this section reference Apple's fiscal year quarters. The holiday quarter, the fourth quarter of the calendar year, is referred to as Apple's Q1. Since 2011, iPhone releases have consistently occurred in September at the end of Q4, meaning that sales of a new model are mostly reflected in Q1 of the following fiscal year, covering October to December.
 Note that Statista presents data in calendar year quarters; Q4 in Statista data corresponds to Apple's FY Q1.
